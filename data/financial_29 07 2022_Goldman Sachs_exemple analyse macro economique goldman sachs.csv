POLICY PICTURE
The Fed appears to have concluded the ""expeditious"" 
phase of its tightening cycle, delivering a 75bps rate hike to 
take the policy rate to their own neutral estimate of 2.25-
2.5%. Markets responded favourably in anticipation of a 
slower pace of tightening ahead (see Chart) given a loss of 
growth momentum, emerging signs of easing inflation 
pressures and the Fed's emphasis on data dependence 
going forward (see quote). 
Overall, we think the outlook for Fed policy has turned more 
balanced. We expect a further rate increase in September, 
with the hike increment being guided by key data releases 
such as the employment cost index, PCE inflation and 
measures of consumer inflation expectations. Thereafter, 
we think signs of softening in both the labour market and 
inflation outturns could see the Fed pause to assess the 
impact of this year's rapid tightening. After all, the Fed has 
raised rates by 2.25% in just five months.  
Notwithstanding the growing accumulation of evidence on 
weaker growth prospects for the second half of the year, 
policymakers appear to be retaining a glass-half-full 
assessment of the economy. During the post-meeting 
press 
conference
 Fed Chair Jerome Powell said he does not 
think the US is currently in recession as ""there are just too 
many areas of the economy that are performing too well."" 
Meanwhile, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen highlighted 
the creation of almost 400,000 jobs a month ""is not a 
recession"" and that a recession would require a ""broad-
based weakening of the economy"" which is inconsistent 
with recent data.

We've been saying we would move expeditiously to get 
to the range of neutral. And I think we've done that 
now. While another unusually large increase could be 
appropriate at our next meeting, that is a decision that 
will depend on the data we get between now and 
then.""

MACRO AT A GLANCE
Economic data has turned more mixed and is not 
consistently supportive of rapid monetary tightening. For 
example, flash composite PMI readings for July were in 
contractionary territory in the US and Euro Area (see 
Chart). Weakness on the services side of the economy 
likely reflects the cost-of-living crisis and indicates the post-
Omicron rebound is behind us. 
In Europe, high inflation continues to weigh on sentiment 
with the German ifo Business Climate index falling to its 
lowest level since June 2020. Meanwhile, the US economy 
experienced its second consecutive quarter of negative 
GDP growth. With nonfarm payroll growth averaging 
375,000 during the second quarter and GDP data subject to 
revisions, we do not think the economy was in a recession 
in the first half of the year, however, we acknowledge risks 
are building. 
NAVIGATING FIXED INCOME
A ""bad news is good news"" dynamic has emerged whereby 
signs of slowing growth and easing inflation pressures 
provides some relief for markets due to reduced risks of 
policy overtightening. That said, within fixed income 
sectors, bouts of weakness in lower-quality bonds reflects 
growing growth concerns (see Chart). 
We used recent strength in high yield corporate credit as an 
opening to scale back our exposure. Overall, we remain 
overweight corporate bonds given continued 
strength in 
corporate balance sheet positions
. However, we are 
mindful of downbeat signals from second quarter earnings 
releases, including signs of slowing consumer demand 
owing to inflation pressures.
