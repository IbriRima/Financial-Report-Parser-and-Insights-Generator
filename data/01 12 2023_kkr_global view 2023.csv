INSIGHTS: OUTLOOK FOR 2023: KEEP IT SIMPLE
Despite all the uncertainty across today's global capital markets, we 
are poised to enter 2023 with a more constructive tilt, especially 
on many parts of Credit.
 Our basic premise is that it will be easier to 
navigate inflation's negative impact on corporate earnings and consumer 
balance sheets in 2023 than it was to invest with inflation continually 
surprising central banks and investors in 2022. However, what we are 
proposing will require both patience and courage - and a game plan that 
leverages the type of long-term frameworks we employ at KKR across 
asset classes and regions. At its core, our message is to 'Keep it Simple' 
in 2023. The massive increase we have seen in short-term interest in 
many instances has created attractive total return opportunities across 
several parts of the global capital markets without having to stretch 
on leverage, volatility, and/or risk. Implicit in our outlook is our strong 
view that now is a good time to be a lender. As such, we continue to 
lean towards collateral-based cash flows such as Infrastructure, Private 
Credit, Real Estate Credit and many parts of Asset-Based Finance. 
We also like some of the convexity that liquid Credit provides after the 
recent sell-off. Within Equities, our advice is to shift away from larger-
capitalization Technology stocks in favor of smaller capitalization names 
with better valuation profiles. History suggests that 2023 will be a good 
vintage year for Private Equity. We also see the U.S. dollar's strength 
reversing, which means that many international assets need to be re-
considered. Finally, while we see the positive relationship between stocks 
and bonds easing in 2023, our longer-term view remains that we have 
entered a regime change that requires a different approach to overall 
global macro and asset allocation.
Truth is ever to be found in the simplicity, and 
not in the multiplicity and confusion of things.

INSIGHTS: OUTLOOK FOR 2023: KEEP IT SIMPLE
With a higher resting heart rate for inflation amidst record stimu-
lus, we have been cautioning for some time that we see a 'dif-
ferent kind of recovery', and that investors should 'walk, not run' 
when it comes to deployment, especially as the correlation be-
tween stocks and bonds turned positive. 
No doubt, we still think 
the macro environment remains challenging, but we now feel 
more emboldened as we think about deployment entering 2023.
 
Key to our thinking are the following considerations
1
Global central banks are much further along in their tightening campaign
, As Chairman Powell said 
recently, rates are 'getting close' to sufficiently restrictive levels. Our work shows that the share of the top 
25 central banks boosting rates will fall to 12% in 2023, compared to fully 84% in 2022. This decline is an 
important one to consider, we believe. We also think the chance of the U.S. dollar bull market continuing 
well into 2023 is now much more limited. This macro consideration is a big deal, in our view
2
United States inflation has peaked
, though it remains quite high. In fact, with this publication, we just 
tweaked our inflation forecast lower for the first time in almost two years. See below for more detail, but a 
'tug of war' between falling housing prices and rising labor costs now better reflects the Fed's intentions 
to cool the economy.
3
Capital markets new supply (i.e., new issuance), which we track closely as a proxy for calling 
bottoms, has dwindled essentially to nothing
. In the United States, for example, we measure that it is 
now approaching the lows we saw in 2009, especially when one adjusts for the growth in GDP since then 
(Exhibit 1)
.
4
A more visible hand: We think government spending will quietly surprise on the upside in 2023
. Our 
travels to major political hubs such as Washington DC, Paris, and Tokyo of late lead us to believe that key 
initiatives like the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA, which we think could be closer to $700 billion versus the 
'headline' of $370 billion) and EU Recovery Budget (EUR1.8 trillion over 2020-2026) will result in more 
spending than many folks think. Meanwhile, spending on military budgets is increasing around the world, 
as geopolitics is no longer a discretionary line item in most government budgets these days. Finally, in 
China, for example, our local research leads us to believe that further stimulus is gaining momentum to 
offset the headwinds created by recent property developer defaults. 
5
The technical picture is actually quite compelling
. Many allocators have de-risked their portfolios, 
especially allocators who likely over-emphasized the stability provided by bonds as we transitioned from 
QE to QT. We also take comfort that the S&P 500 has already corrected 25%, an important 'lean in' signal 
based on history, as well as that most High Yield bonds now trade at 85 cents on the dollar, another signal 
that one should add back some risks to a diversified portfolio. Importantly, our view is that the massive 
adjustment in the risk-free rate, not necessarily a record widening of credit spreads, will be what is 
remembered about the opportunity set created during this tightening cycle.

INSIGHTS: OUTLOOK FOR 2023: KEEP IT SIMPLE
So, after what we believe will be a dismal earnings season in 
January, 
we think investors should accelerate to at least a 
jog from a walk in terms of deployment budgeting for 2023 
as well as lean more aggressively into the periodic bouts 
of dislocation we continue to forecast during the next 
12-18 months
. Simply stated, the recession fears we face in 
2023 are likely less ominous and more in the price than the 
inflation fears that surprised markets in 2022. 
To be clear, though, we are not advocating a 
full
 'risk-on' 
approach like we did after COVID roiled the markets. So, our 
call to arms is not to 'buy the market' with abandon. Rather, 
it is to be selective within and across asset classes. Key to 
our thinking is that:
1. 
Earnings estimates are still too high
, and falling unit 
volume in recent months will become more apparent as 
inflation cools. European earnings, in particular, look to 
be at risk in the first half of 2023.
2. 
Some parts of the market still need to correct
. Large 
cap 'old economy' Technology stocks, for example, are 
still over-owned by both institutions and individuals. 
This reality is also occurring at a time of increased 
competition and regulatory oversight. Looking ahead, we 
see Technology being less than 20% of the S&P 500 
weighting within the next few years, compared to what 
we think was a peak of 29.1% in 4Q21. See below for 
details on our analysis. 
3. 
There are still some spicy capital structures, debt in 
particular, in challenged sectors
 of the economy that will 
be tested in the slower growth and higher rate environment 
we envision. Negative operating leverage, 'layering' of old 
debt with new debt (a product of weak documentation 
during the go-go years), and refinancing risks will all be 
important issues to sidestep in 2023, we believe. 
4. 
We still don't fully understand QT
. The European and the 
U.S. central banks both want to shrink the size of their 
massive balance sheets, which now total 65% and 33%, 
respectively, of their GDPs. Translating this reduction into 
rate hike equivalents feels much more like art than science, 
and as such, our expectation is that this process takes 
longer and acts as more of an overhang on liquidity and 
financial conditions than in prior cycles. We also forecast 
that short rates do not come down as fast as the consen-
sus expects, given that we see inflation being above the 
Fed's target for at least five years in a row (2021-2025e). 
5. 
We expect to see some unexpected provisioning around 
Office Real Estate and non-secured consumer lending 
in 2023,
 which could surprise some banks and investors 
in the coming quarters.
So, against this backdrop, our most important message 
is to keep it simple and buy simplicity
. Indeed, as Isaac 
Newton once said, ""Truth is ever to be found in the 
simplicity, and not in the multiplicity and confusion of 
things."" We think it is also the time to diversify across 
multiple asset classes 

 not concentrate one's portfolio the 
same way one would have during the 2010-2020 period.
If we are right, then Credit makes more sense to own than 
Equities right now across most asset classes. Indeed, given 
that many traditional banks are reining in their lending, now 
is a good time in many instances to be a provider of capital, 
especially to businesses that align with our key themes. 
Just consider that our S&P 500 target is up only marginally 
versus current levels, while senior Direct Lending offers 
returns well north of 10%. Within Credit, keep it simple. 
Specifically, we favor shorter duration, bigger companies, 
and attractive call protection features. Further, we also still 
favor collateral linked to higher nominal GDP growth.

How Has Our Thinking Evolved
Action Item
Rate of Change Matters
. 
While we still see a higher 
resting heart rate for inflation this cycle, we think that 
headline inflation peaked in the latter half of 2022. We 
expect a peak tightening of financial conditions to occur in 
2023. 
We recently lowered our 2023 U.S. inflation forecast for the 
first time in almost two years to 3.9% from 4.8%. As part of 
this transition, we expect nominal GDP growth to slow by fully 
50% to about four percent in 2023 from 10% in 2022. As 
such, we expect the dollar to be less of a headwind to financial 
conditions in 2023. We also expect less duration risk for bonds, 
a notable change in our thinking about asset allocation.
Earnings.
 We have higher conviction in our long-held 
view that earnings will decline in 2023, and we see a lower 
than normal rebound in EPS in 2024. This backdrop means 
creaky capital structures will be under pressure, especially 
those with challenged margin expectations 
It is too early to just buy all risk assets across the board. 
Rather, an allocator should focus on long-term attractive 
valuations in key areas such as Small-Cap Equities, unlevered 
Private Credit, Real Estate Debt, and select parts of High Yield 
and Investment Grade Debt. Defendable margins will be key 
across all asset classes.
Labor.
 We are growing more convinced that the worker 
shortage in the United States is structural in nature, given 
the intersection of demographic trends and pandemic-
related behavioral changes. All told, in the U.S., for 
example, we think the labor force is missing about four 
million workers, with only about half likely to return at 
some point. So, we concur with Chairman Powell's view 
that the labor market is ""out of balance.""
This realization is part of our thesis that structurally higher 
inflation is the new normal and will be 'stickier' for longer. We 
favor automation, digitalization, and family care services, all of 
which help to address the current labor shortage. We also think 
it is more important than ever for management teams to be 
aligned with their workforces.
House Prices Under Pressure.
 
Housing is one of the 
most direct ways that central banks have been able to slow 
growth. In the U.S., for example, we now forecast home 
price depreciation of minus five percent in both 2023 and 
2024, respectively. Previously, we had assumed modest 
home price appreciation in our annual forecasts.
Household net worth is falling faster this cycle than any 
other cycle on record (
Exhibit 27
). As such, being right that 
unemployment does not spike is a key underpinning to our 
overall macro thesis. Remember we have unemployment in the 
U.S. increasing trough to peak by 1.4%, compared to an average 
of 3.7% during recessions.
Goods Deflation, Services Inflation.
 We have 
higher conviction in our goods deflation thesis; at the same 
time, we believe that inflation has shifted to the services 
arena and will stay higher for longer. 
Our long exposures remain much more tilted towards Services 
than Goods. We continue to forecast a recession in the 
Goods sector in 2023, partially offset by an increase in global 
Services spending.
Asynchronous Recovery.
 It is too simplistic in our 
view to simply talk about one synchronized global economy. 
Asia's inflation and monetary policy profiles are now wildly 
different than the West's. Meanwhile, the U.S. is food and 
energy independent at a time when Europe and Emerging 
Markets are experiencing an unprecedented 'war shock.'
Despite our view that the U.S. dollar is peaking, our models 
still do 
not
 show Emerging Markets as a high conviction 'Buy'. 
As such, we continue to favor selectivity across regions. For 
example, we like corporate carve-outs in Korea and Japan, and 
we favor higher growth markets such as India and Vietnam.
Real Rates.
 Despite near record tightening, we see 
real rates staying below three percent this cycle. By 
comparison, the Fed brought real rates above three percent 
at least one time each decade from the 1960s through the 
early 2000s.
Our base case has fed funds reaching 5.125% in mid-2023 be-
fore settling in at 4.875% by year end. The market is much more 
bullish on the Fed accelerating rate cuts in late 2023/2024. 
Meanwhile, in Europe, we forecast the ECB to boost short rates 
to 3.5% in 2023 through the end of 2024. We expect a longer-
term neutral rate closer to 2.25% in Europe.

INSIGHTS: OUTLOOK FOR 2023: KEEP IT SIMPLE
We also want to mention that 2023 will feel a lot different 
than 2022. We note the following:
1
The pace of central bank tightening is likely 
peaking.
 The percentage of the top 25 global central 
banks that will be tightening by the end of 2023 will 
likely be closer to 12%, compared to around 84% in 
the fourth quarter of 2022.
2
After surging to double-digit levels post 
pandemic, we see nominal GDP growth cooling in 
2023
. We expect U.S. nominal GDP to fall to 4.2% 
in 2023 from 9.9% in 2022. This is a big drop and 
likely means that duration becomes less of a cycle risk over 
the next 12 months.
3
We forecast that U.S. real wage growth will 
likely turn positive in 2023.
 If we are right 
and
 
unemployment lags versus other cycles, we do 
States.
 
not envision a 2008-type downturn in the United 
4
We no longer see the USD as a safe haven. 
We 
expect the recent dollar downtrend to continue in 
2023, and as such, we are looking for hedges that 
will perform if the U.S. dollar actually weakens 
further than expected.
5
The negative impact of inflation will shift from 
resetting upward the risk-free rate in 2022 
to putting pressure on corporate profits and 
consumer balance sheets in 2023. 
If we are right, 
then longer-term rates may peak temporarily as earnings 
disappoint.
6
China's re-opening in 2023 helps Asia get out of 
its growth funk. 
We have growth above consensus 
in both 2023 and 2024. We think China's shift 
in its zero COVID-policy leads to a run of better 
growth in Asia by the middle of next year.
Our bottom line:
 
As we enter 2023, it is important to 
note that we still live in a world where both investors and 
corporations are struggling to accurately price the cost of 
capital across different parts of the economy as well as 
different parts of the capital structure. Therein lies the 
opportunity, we believe
.
In terms of key signals we are watching to pick up the pace 
of deployment, the following three data points are top of 
mind. See below and SECTION III for full details, but we think 
that all of these may happen sometime in mid-2023:
1. 
The Fed stops tightening as inflation comes under 
control, and in doing so, it further cools the U.S. dollar 
(Exhibit 2). 
2. 
Earnings estimates trough (remember though that 
overall earnings tend to bottom six to nine months after 
markets do.)
3. 
We enter a technical recession in the United States 
during 2023 (markets tend to bottom about half way 
through a recession, 
see 
Exhibit 90)
.

In terms of key themes, we note the following: 
Buy Simplicity Not Complexity at this Point in the Cycle. 
When markets get expensive, we have often favored 
complexity over simplicity to avoid overpaying (see 
Play Your 
Game: Outlook for 2020
). This current period, however, is not 
one of those times. When it comes to Credit, investors should 
buy high quality credits and mortgages where the company 
or collateral is cash flowing. For cross-over funds, we 
particularly like preferred or convertible security offerings 
that plug a financing hole, especially where there is an 
incentive to get called away within a few years and/or pay 
down the debt. Within Equities, small cap stocks are cheap 
by almost all metrics, and on a currency adjusted basis Real 
Estate in the UK and many sectors in Japan (banks and 
certain multinationals in particular) are cheap, we believe. By 
comparison, now is not the time to try to call the bottom on 
unprofitable Tech or lend to a zombie company to capture an 
additional 100-200 basis points of yield.

Real Assets: We Still Favor Collateral-Based Cash Flows 
and Continue to Pound the Table on this Theme.
 Our 
proprietary survey work suggests that because too many 
investors are still underweight Real Assets in their portfolios, 
there remains a high degree of latent demand for this asset 
class across insurance companies, family offices, and 
endowments and foundations. Moreover, the fundamentals 
are compelling, especially on the Energy, Asset-Based 
Finance, Real Estate Credit, and Infrastructure sides of the 
business. Also, as we detail below, we think that Real Assets, 
and Energy in particular, could be a really important hedge if 
the dollar is not as strong in 2023.
Ongoing Labor Shortages Will Only Accelerate the Trend 
Towards Automation/Digitalization. 
With labor costs 
soaring amidst sluggish demographics, a dearth of trained 
workers for key sectors, a lower participation rate and 
less immigration, we think that corporations will focus 
increasingly on technology-driven productivity gains. To this 
end, we recently saw robots 'working' in both Heathrow 
Airport and a restaurant in Tokyo. Without question, we 
are still in an era of innovation, and think that the pace of 
disruption will only accelerate, particularly as it relates to 
technological change across multiple industries faced with 
increasing labor costs. So, if history is any guide, worker 
scarcity will inspire another era of automation discoveries 
including a greater focus on worker re-training (

Resiliency: The Security of Everything. 
Recent travels 
across Asia, Europe, and the U.S. confirm that, as my 
colleague Vance Serchuk often reminds me, we have shifted 
from a period of benign globalization to one of great power 
competition. This shift is a big deal, and it means that 
countries, corporations, and even individuals will need to 
build out more redundancy across not only energy but also 
data, food, pharma, technology, water, and transportation. 
These sectors and their supply chains will be subject to 
greater geopolitical oversight, in terms of both industrial 
policy intended to build national providers of these services 
and also scrutiny of foreign investment and resiliency of 
supply chains. Also, almost all aspects of defense spending 
are poised to surge, we believe. All told, our 'security of 
everything' concept represents hundreds of billions of dollars 
in opex and capex that may help to cushion the blow of the 
global economic slowdown we are experiencing.

The Energy Transition Remains a Mega-Theme. 
This theme 
is probably as massive as the Internet opportunity was 
around the turn of the century. It will likely lead to the same 
variety of outcomes and bifurcation in results 

 think Pets.
com's bankruptcy versus Amazon's success. Said differently, 
there will be both winners and losers as this mega-theme 
unfolds, though the generosity of the recent Inflation 
Reduction Act should lead to more winners than losers in 
the United States, we believe. Interestingly, though, 
while the 
Internet was a deflationary global force, the energy transition 
is an inflationary one
. Most commodities required to support 
growth in onshore wind, offshore wind, batteries, etc., need a 
lot of energy to mine and process. Moreover, many of these 
commodities are sourced from unstable areas of the globe. 
Around 65% of the total global refining of such commodities, 
including lithium (72%), cobalt (71%), and manganese 
(99%) is now done in China at a time when U.S.-China

Normalization:
 
Revenge of Services.
 For the better part of 
two years now we have been suggesting that U.S. consump-
tion would eventually normalize, with Services gaining wallet 
share at the expense of Goods. That call has largely been the 
right one over the last year, and we think it will continue to 
play out in 2023. Given that U.S. Goods buying is still run-
ning seven percent 
above
 trend (down from a peak of 17% in 
2021) and Services is running one percent 
below
 trend (up 
from six percent below in 2021), we continue to support flip-
ping exposures towards Services, which we now think could 
run ahead of trend for several more years. However, this is 
not just a U.S. call. In Asia, for example, the economy is now 
just opening up, and as a result, Services activity is still well 
below pre-COVID levels. As such, if the U.S. is a precursor to 
what other economies will experience, sectors such as tour-
ism, health and beauty services, and entertainment still have 
a long way to go internationally, we believe.
For the better part of two years

In terms of Picks and Pans, we note the following:
 PICK (SAME) 
 
Simple Credit looks attractive to us.
 True, 
spreads have not blown out like in 2008, but the risk-free 
rate now embeds a lot of bad news, and absolute yields 
look extremely attractive in a world that we think argues 
for lower overall returns for most portfolios during the next 
5-10 years. At the moment we like high quality municipal 
bonds, mortgages, CLO IG /A-AAA liabilities, senior direct 
lending, etc. See our relative value discussion in SECTION 
III -
 Question #1
 for full details, but we want to be a liquidity 
provider when others can't. 
 PICK (NEW) 
 
Distinct
 
sector
 
selectivity within public 
markets
. From a public market sector perspective, we 
favor Energy, Industrials (including Defense names), and 
Big Pharma at the expense of Large Cap Technology and 
any unsecured lending across Financials and/or Consumer 
sectors. 
 PICK (NEW) 
 
The Russell 2000 is at an attractive entry 
point for long-term investors, in our view.
 All told, the 
Russell 2000's next 12 months P/E ratio has fallen to 10.8x, 
its lowest level since 1990 and 30% below its long-term 
average. On a relative basis, the Russell 2000's next 12 
months P/E is trading at the lowest level versus large-cap 
stocks since the Tech Bubble.
 PICK (NEW) 
 
International hard assets. 
Many global 
currencies are still on sale, and as such, we think that 
strategic buyers are going to start shopping overseas for 
hard assets, especially in the Real Estate and Infrastructure 
sectors. Therefore, we believe allocators will need to move 
quickly to acquire quality Real Estate assets in key metro 
markets such as London, Paris, and Tokyo. We also like fiber 
and data plays across most parts of the world, a theme we 
have been aggressively playing through our Infrastructure 
allocations at KKR. See below for details and 
Exhibit 2 
above, 
but we view the current period as a unique opportunity 
where, on a dollar adjusted basis, hard assets in many parts 
of both Europe and Asia still look quite attractive.

INSIGHTS: OUTLOOK FOR 2023: KEEP IT SIMPLE
 PICK (NEW) 
 
'Cyclical' hedges that might work as the 
dollar weakens, including select EM and Commodities, 
such as Oil and Copper.
 Our travels and conversations with 
CIOs lead us to believe that most investors, regardless of 
region, are overweight dollar-based assets. This decision has 
been the right one in recent years, but the technical picture 
makes us want to add some 'spice' in the form of out of the 
money copper and/or oil calls, or some beaten down EM 
where we like the long-term fundamentals (e.g., Vietnam).
 PICK (NEW) 
 
Dividend yielding and growing Equities.
 As 
those who have followed our work know, we have been 
advocating owning rising earnings and rising dividend stories 
over different periods over the last twenty years. Now is one 
of those periods, we believe. To be clear, we don't favor just 
high dividend yields. Rather, we favor companies with rising 
free cash flow that allows them to consistently increase 
their dividends and earnings per share. See our note 
The 
Uncomfortable Truth
 for further details, but one could also 
just buy the Dividend Aristocracy basket and call it a day.
 PICK (NEW) 
 
Non-correlated assets should be added at 
the expense of traditional long/short hedge funds,
 we 
believe. Too many allocators are still overweight long/short 
equity funds in their hedge fund portfolios. Our base view is 
that more CIOs should be concentrating their book in hedge 
fund managers that can provide non-correlated returns 
to equity markets. We also think that allocators should 
align with managers that 'stay in their lanes' in terms of 
liquidity. Indeed, as we learned in our recent endowment and 
foundation survey (see 
The Times they Are a-Changin'
), many 
CIOs now own illiquid hedge fund portfolios in their liquid 
books. 
 PICK (NEW) 
 
Private Vintages.
 As we show in 
Exhibit 
18
, the value of the illiquidity premium tends to increase in 
bumpy markets. Linear deployment is essential to portfolio 
construction in the private markets, and one of our key 
messages for 2023 is to lean into both Private Equity and 
Private Credit right now.
 PAN (NEW) 
 Begin to sell USD.
 Despite the USD coming 
back towards earth in recent weeks, we still think the dollar 
is overbought and over-owned. It clearly has been the right 
call to own dollar assets for several years (
Exhibits 2, 99, 
and 
100
). However, we feel that this trade has begun to turn. We 
like JPY as a long against the dollar as well as some higher 
yielding, higher quality EM currencies. Tactically, we also 
think the EUR may have bottomed. 
 PAN (SAME) 
 Similar to last year, we are still cautious on 
large cap Technology
. This sector is valuation challenged 
at a time when fundamentals, especially around online 
advertising and social media, are still deteriorating and 
competition is increasing. At the same time, we continue to 
think that globally, greater government regulation of Tech is 
increasingly on the table at a time when global geopolitical 
competition is heating up. See below for details, but once 
a sector peaks at over 20% of an index, it tends to badly 
underperform over the next three to five years.
 PAN (NEW) 
 Select parts of the Banking sector, 
particularly those tethered to floating rate mortgages. 
There are several areas within the financial sector where 
we expect to see faster than expected deterioration in loan 
loss provisions. For starters, we envision tougher sledding 
for certain financial institutions in Canada and Australia, as 
many of the mortgages in those countries are floating rate 
(
Exhibit 14
). House prices are also likely to slip further in 
2023; at the same time, higher payment rates on mortgages 
will coincide with slowing nominal GDP growth. Conversely, 
Japanese banks would benefit mightily if global GDP does 
not slow but inflation does ease. Meanwhile, we think that 
'old' parts of commercial office space will likely create some 
angst as debt for large scale office complexes matures in 
2023 and 2024. 
 PAN (SAME) 
 Goods as consumer spending shifts to 
Services
. As the economy cools and consumers shift their 
focus back towards experiences over things, we envision 
that the Goods sector, including the distributors of retail 
products, could face significant headwinds. Within Goods,

as we suggested in our midyear outlook, we still see private 
label taking aggressive market share from branded products.
 PAN (NEW) 
 Segments of Commercial Real Estate may 
face incremental headwinds in 2023.
 In our view, certain 
parts of the traditional 
Office
 sector could face challenges 
in 2023, especially older properties that 1) do not have 
environmentally friendly footprints; 2) will need to roll their 
debt at higher rates; and 3) are exposed to sectors that 
face significant headcount reductions or work from home 
headwinds (e.g., large parts of the Technology sector). There 
is also growing concern that some banks may foreclose on 
office buildings at reduced prices, which could reset the 
entire market for commodity office buildings. Don't get us 
wrong, though, there are significant opportunities in Office 
Real Estate and we are actually believers in back to work, but 
one needs to be eyes wide open that using the 'old' playbook 
will not yield the same results as in the past. To this end, we 
think a significant opportunity exists in buying high quality 
new assets at discounts to replacement costs in high growth 
markets, especially as market participants may sell assets to 
deleverage other parts of their portfolios.
 PAN (NEW) 
 Interest rate volatility is now overstated and 
should be sold, particularly at the front end of the curve.
 
Key to our thinking: the fed funds futures market won't 
experience a 400 basis point surprise in 2023 the way it 
did in 2022, and bond yields and term premia are now much 
closer to our targets. Against this backdrop, hedging against 
higher interest rates entails a more nuanced tradeoff, in our 
opinion, while securities with built-in call risk such as MBS 
should become more appealing.
In terms of risks to our overall outlook, there are four 
major risks where we are focused: 
Risk #1: Growth Slows Sharply Towards More of a 2008-
Type Downturn. 
Our forecasts are predicated on growth 
slowing but not collapsing in a 2008-like fashion. One 
can see this in 
Exhibits 22
 and 
23
, respectively. There are 
three things to consider, we believe. First, we forecast 
unemployment increasing by 1.4% point trough to peak 
today, more akin to the 1.9% increase in 2001 compared to 
2008 when unemployment surged 5.1%. Second, we also 
don't see the banks needing to de-leverage as much as they 
did during the GFC. Most leverage levels are at 10-12x, not 
20-30x. Finally, we do not think that underlying equity in 
mortgages gets impaired, given better underwriting, tighter 
supply, and more equity in each deal. To be sure, we have 
house prices falling five percent in 2023 (
Exhibit 113)
, down 
from 14% appreciation in 2022, but we do not forecast a 
major collapse in major economies such as the U.S, France 
and Germany (
Exhibit 14)
. So, if the environment becomes 
much worse than we anticipate and we experience 2008-like 
stresses to the system, then our decision to steadily add risk 
during 2023 could be the wrong one.

Risk #2: We Go Back to Secular Disinflation (i.e., 2010-
2020). 
Our macro calls as well as our asset allocation 
positioning could be out of whack if inflation crashes 
towards pre-pandemic levels (i.e., we go back to the lower 
left quadrant in 
Exhibit 16
). If this happens, then the 'right' 
playbook is to go back to what worked in 2010-2016 
(average inflation during this period was just 1.6%). Said 
differently, if there is not a higher resting heart rate for 
inflation this cycle, then investors should lean into high 
growth, low cash flowing equities with big total addressable 
markets (TAMs), and/or own super long duration fixed 
income. However, given that we see wages being stickier 
this cycle amidst strong demand for 25-54 year old workers 
(
Exhibit 13
), we ascribe less than a one in five chance to this 
outcome.

Risk #3: The Fed Needs to Do Substantially More to 
Control Inflation. 
Our current base case expects the 'real' 
fed funds rate (i.e., fed funds - Y/y CPI) to rise to just above 
two percent in 2024 (
Exhibit 17
). That forecast is materially 
higher than the peak of about 80 basis points on a quarterly 
basis during the last Fed hiking cycle, but lower than the 
median peak over the last sixty years (which is actually 
around three percent or more). Indeed, history would 
suggest that the Fed may end up delivering more tightening 
than we currently expect in order to control inflation in 2023, 
particularly given the fact that wage growth remains high 
and consumer inflation expectations remain elevated. If we 
are wrong about how high rates need to go this cycle to quell 
strong wage growth (i.e., if real rates need to rise above 
two percent), it could materially dent the outlook for all risk 
assets. However, we see the chance of this occurring at less 
than one in four; moreover, there are several ways to hedge 
these considerations in a cost-efficient manner, including 
through fed funds futures. 
Moreover, as we look at the bigger picture, our base view 
is that macro fat tails are narrowing, not widening, as we 
enter 2023. As such, we think the possibility of very low 
inflation, really high inflation, or a 2008-type event is fading, 
not increasing. So against this backdrop, our message is to 
thoughtfully lean into risk using a disciplined deployment 
schedule, sound portfolio construction, and ample 
diversification across asset classes and regions in 2023.

Risk #4: Heightened Geopolitical/Political Risks 
Harking 
back to Adam Smith's famous work, it feels to us that we 
have entered an era where the visible hand of politics and 
geopolitics appears to be quickly overpowering the invisible 
hand that defined increased economic globalization/harmony 
during the past few decades. Indeed, throughout the world 
(U.S., Europe, China), nations that have for a generation 
maintained legitimacy and support by delivering strong 
economic growth in part via cheap money, energy, and labor 
are now entering eras where all of these inputs are more 
expensive - at a time when institutional legitimacy is at an 
all-time low and populism is high. Moreover, this backdrop is 
occurring at a moment of heightened geopolitical tensions. 
This combination will likely mean more unexpected political 
outcomes such as government shutdowns as well as more 
changes in approaches to government (e.g., Brexit); it also 
means much more FDI scrutiny and possible restrictions. 
On the one hand, there are real opportunities to invest as 
nations build domestic energy, semiconductor, and other 
supply chains. To this end, we remain quite bullish on our 
Resiliency/Security of Everything thesis, including the 
benefits of reshoring. On the other hand, investors will need 
a sharper domestic political and geopolitical lens for all 
investments in this new era of great power competition. 
Section I: Global / Regional Economic 
Forecasts
Global
Our message on growth and inflation for much of the 
developed world remains largely the same as in prior 
years. Specifically, we continue to expect slowing growth 
and higher inflation than many developed economies 
experienced during the post-GFC era. What has changed is 
that consensus has now chopped a lot of wood in 'catching 
down' to this new reality. As a result, we enter 2023 with 
greater optimism that our conservative bent towards a de-
rating of growth expectations is now more likely in the price. 
Meanwhile, in China we now look for better growth in both 
2023 and 2024, which puts our forecasts above consensus, 
as consumption improves. We do see near-term risks to 
our China outlook as infections rise during the next several 
months, which will likely weigh on mobility and spending. On 
the other hand, increased immunity could provide a tailwind 
for growth in the second half of 2023 and into 2024. 
In terms of important develop-
ments we are watching for, they 
differ by region. In Asia, we ex-
pect continued normalization in 
consumer activity, which should 
help year-over-year comparisons, 
especially in the Services sec-
tor. In Europe, we expect a war-
induced recession, though fuel 
subsidies and a mild winter should 
help. Finally, in the United States 
we look for a 2001-type reces-
sion, driven by weakness in hous-
ing and inventory destocking.

In the U.S. for 2023 and 2024 we assign a probability of 50% for the base case, 35% 
for the bear case, and 15% for the bull case. In Europe we assign the downside 20th 
percentile and the bull case 80% percentile. For China: In 2023, we assign a probability 
of 60% for the base case, 20% for the bear case, and 20% for the bull case. In 2024, 
we assign a probability of 50% for the base case, 25% for the bear case, and 25% for 
the bull case. Note that the bear case in the U.S. assumes a deep recession in 2023, 
but also assumes a bit more of a snapback in 2024. Data as at December 13, 2022.

Harking back to Adam Smith's 
famous work, it feels to us that 
we have entered an era where 
the visible hand of politics and 
geopolitics appears to be quickly 
overpowering the invisible hand 
that defined increased economic 
globalization/harmony during the 
past few decades.

U.S. GDP Outlook
 As we show in 
Exhibit 24
, we retain 
a conservative outlook for U.S. GDP. Home prices have 
declined faster than expected this year, which leads us 
to take down our 2023 U.S. Real GDP growth estimate 
modestly from +0.5% to +0.3%. From a bigger picture 
perspective, we note that full-year GDP growth at that 
level is more consistent with a 2001-style recession than 
a 2008-style growth implosion. For example, we forecast 
monthly unemployment to increase 1.4% from a trough of 
3.5% to a peak of 4.9% this cycle. That would be in line 
with 2001's 1.9% increase, and well below the GFC's 5.1% 
increase.

As our quantitative model 
(Exhibit 24)
 shows, consumer 
excess savings have been helping to sustain growth better 
than what one might think. On the other hand, both high 
energy prices as well as falling housing activity are acting as 
major drags. Unfortunately, given some of our recent survey 
work around mortgages 
(Exhibit 25)
, interest rates are now 
at such a level that buyers will likely re-trench for some time, 
we believe.

In terms of specific components to GDP, my colleague Dave 
McNellis forecasts consumer PCE growth falls to almost zero 
in 2023, down materially from +2.7% in 2022. He does see 
some improvement thereafter, as the benefit of positive real 
wage growth eventually flows through the system. At the 
same time, however, Dave has a stronger forecast for capital 
expenditures, which one can see in 
Exhibit 28
. The Inflation 
Reduction Act could surprise on the high side in terms of 
spending, we think, while our conversations with CEOs lead 
us to believe that capex and opex will not fall off as much as 
during prior downturns. This tailwind should help to offset 
weaker consumer spending as well as ongoing inventory de-
stocking (
Exhibit 26
). 
Looking out to 2024, our expectation is that GDP growth 
re-accelerates only modestly to 1.5% from 0.3% in 2023. 
Importantly, we see the hangover of a soft U.S. housing 
market continuing into 2024, given that we expect Fed policy 
will remain tight and mortgage rates elevated. We also think 
that goods-related consumption spending will be slow to 
recover following what was a surge of pandemic-era buying 
in 2020-21. These headwinds offset other positives that we 
see potentially emerging as we look out into 2024, including 
resilient commercial capex spending and improvements 
in net exports as Europe and Asia start to emerge from 
economic soft patches.
The Inflation Reduction Act could 
surprise on the high side in terms 
of spending, we think, while our 
conversations with CEOs lead us 
to believe that capex and opex will

INSIGHTS: OUTLOOK FOR 2023: KEEP IT SIMPLE
U.S. Inflation Outlook
 We are revising down our 2023 
full-year U.S. CPI forecast to 3.9% from 4.8% previously. 
Notably, this is the first time we have taken down an inflation 
forecast since 2021. We think the back-to-back downside 
surprises in October and November U.S. CPI were indeed 
significant, as the details showed a convincing pattern of 
peaking shelter inflation, cooling medical inflation, and falling 
goods prices, consistent with our longstanding thesis on 
deflationary goods and inflationary services. While these 
developments do not make us want to lower our outlook 
for fed funds (in fact, we are raising our December 2023 
forecast +25 basis points to 4.875%), they do cause us to 
assign less weight to our high case Fed scenarios (See U.S. 
Rates section, below, for more details). 
Without question, the road ahead will still be bumpy, with 
durable goods potentially cooling in a nonlinear manner 
and government data catching up to the rent growth that is 
already incorporated into our proprietary leading indicators. 
Moreover, we continue to expect CPI to settle at a higher 
resting rate this cycle, most notably because labor costs 
and consumer expectations remain inflationary. However, 
the good news is that the direction of travel has definitely 
improved, which gives us more confidence that the U.S. 
will avoid our worst-case scenarios for inflation and Fed 
tightening this cycle.
Key U.S. Inflation Takeaways
1
We have higher conviction that goods inflation will be negative on a year-over-year basis in 2023. That 
being said, we do not expect goods prices to cool in a linear fashion as some companies have pushed 
through price increases even as real consumer demand has stagnated.
2
Services inflation appears to be stabilizing, albeit at levels that remain much too high. Importantly, within 
Services, shelter inflation is in the process of peaking, we believe. 
3
Labor costs are the single most inflationary input into our KKR Core CPI indicator. While we think that 
overall inflation has likely peaked, the combination of higher incomes and a higher tolerance for inflation 
raises the risk of periodic re-accelerations in CPI over the course of this cycle.
4
Corporate margins will remain under pressure in 2023. The reality of higher labor costs amidst slowing 
nominal GDP will create a backdrop that further dents margins for businesses.
Bottom line:
 We now have greater conviction that core inflation has peaked, which diminishes the odds of a worst-case 
scenario when it comes to peak fed funds. At the same time, we continue to be guards-up about earnings as wage growth 
rises above CPI inflation and goods prices turn negative year-over-year. Said differently, the focus is shifting from 'how 
high inflation goes in 2022' to 'how high inflation stays in 2023 and beyond', meaning that defendable margins are

Euro Area GDP Outlook
 We revise up our estimates for 
growth in 2023 from -0.5% to -0.2%, primarily reflecting 
a less severe energy shortage due to the unseasonably 
mild start to the winter in 2022-2023, and introduce a 
forecast for 1.6% growth in 2024. We also note that despite 
a roughly 25% fall in gas consumption across the economy, 
industrial production has thus far held up well compared to 
pre-war norms. Finally, the level of fiscal support offered 
by governments has surprised to the upside, most notably 
in Germany, where the economic 'defense shield' alone 
makes EUR200 billion available to offset the impact of the 
current energy shock. Despite these positives, we still expect 
the Euro Area economy to contract due to tighter financial 
conditions caused by restrictive monetary policy (not just 
reflecting higher rates, but also quantitative tightening), 
alongside higher inflation depressing household spending 
power and impacting corporate earnings. As such, we 
believe asset allocators should continue to avoid cyclical 
exposure and remain invested behind structural growth 
areas such as labor market solutions, industrial automation, 
and energy security.

Fiscal Response to Energy Crisis: Allocation to Shield
Households and Firms From Rising Energy Costs, % of GDP
Data as at November 29, 2022.Source: Bruegel.
Key Euro Area GDP Takeaways
1
We expect high energy costs to curtail household purchasing power as well as force some manufacturers 
to curb production. However, fiscal support should provide some cushion.
2
Tighter financial conditions will likely be a drag on business investment. Weaker global demand could hurt 
export growth for Europe in 2023 despite a weak euro.
3
Uncertainty around gas supply is the key downside risk to GDP. Further disruption to gas markets 
(e.g., adverse weather conditions or a complete halting of Russian gas flows) puts GDP and our mild 
manageable recession forecast at risk. In this scenario, we model a more severe recession lasting into 
1Q24, with a peak to trough fall in GDP of 2.5%. 
4
Our bull case is based on the assumption of a gradual relaxation of tension in global energy markets and 
easing inflation concerns, leading to Eurozone GDP growth in 2023 of 1.5%.
5
We expect labor markets to remain more resilient than in previous crises due to structural tightness in 
labor supply and consequent reluctance of employers to cut workers.
Bottom line:
 We believe investors should plan for the Eurozone economy to contract by 0.2% over the next twelve months 
before entering a period of moderate recovery, with growth of 1.6% in 2024.

Euro Area Inflation Outlook 
We revise up our inflation 
forecast for 2023 to 6.3% from 5.5% compared to a 
consensus of 5.9%. For 2024, we expect inflation to cool 
to 2.6% versus a consensus estimate of 2.5%. The impetus 
for our revision remains higher energy and food prices, 
both largely compliments of the ongoing war in Ukraine. 
However, we also see underlying core inflation proving 
stickier than anticipated, as firms continue to pass on higher 
production costs to consumers. What are the upside risks 
to our forecasts? While not our base case given supplies 
have largely been filled for this winter, further disruption to 
gas supplies would likely increase inflationary pressures in 
the Euro Area, as would adverse weather considerations, 
and tighter gas markets, particularly if/when Chinese LNG 
demand returns towards normal. 
The other key area of focus for investors is wage growth. 
So far, households have been taking meaningful real wage 
cuts, amidst surging inflation. However, if employers are 
forced to step up their compensation, there is the additional 
risk of a wage-inflation spiral, further embedding inflationary 
pressure.

China 
China GDP Outlook
 We forecast that China GDP growth will 
improve to 5.2% in 2023 and 5.4% in 2024, up from 2.5% 
in 2022. These estimates are higher than the consensus 
forecast of 4.8% for 2023 and 4.8% for 2024, respectively. 
Key to our thinking is that China's exit from zero-COVID and 
reopening will help bring consumption back to trend in 2023-
24, while looser fiscal policy and infrastructure investment 
will help support broader activity. At the same time, we 
see signs that the property sector is bottoming, helped by 
government policy aimed at disarming liquidity and default 
risks, with housing sales likely stabilizing at a low level 
following a dismal 2022.
In the near term, how China navigates the COVID reopening 
process remains a key area of focus for us. Three years 
into the pandemic, China is finally abandoning its rigid 
COVID controls and aligning its approach to the virus with 
the rest of the world. But with only a 40% booster rate for 
the 80+ year-old population, and limited immunity from 
previous infections, we continue to think that China is likely 
to experience a medical resource shortage in the coming 
months. Said differently, even though restrictions intended to 
combat the virus have been lifted, the virus itself may impact 
both domestic activity and global supply chains in the near 
term.
The good news, however, is that we expect these 
dislocations to be short-lived, with a clearer recovery 
starting in 2Q23 once the current surge in infections 
fades and immunity improves. In particular, we think that 
China's consumer economy is primed for a strong recovery, 
especially in categories like travel. To this end, we note that 
total retail sales in China are still running about 12% below 
the pre-pandemic trend, while excess cash deposits now 
total RMB22 trillion, which equates to fully 51% of 2021 
retail sales. Importantly, the experience of other regional 
economies suggests that consumer spending can recover 
quite robustly after reopening - for instance, Korea and

We also wanted to flag that, despite all of the rhetoric around 
U.S.-China tensions and decoupling between East and West 
of late, China has actually become more integrated into the 
global economy in many instances. Indeed, when former 
President Trump imposed tariffs of 15% to 25% on China's 
exports to the U.S., trailing 12 months U.S. imports from 
China amounted to $526 billion. As of 3Q22, that amount 
stands at $568 billion, an increase of eight percent.

Key Big Picture China and Asia Takeaways
1
Many factors weighing on China have reached peak pain and should begin to improve from here, including 
an exit path from zero-COVID and less of a drag from the property market (-0.5 ppt in 2023 vs. -2.9 ppt in 
2022) now that the Authorities have stepped in. 
2
Consumption should also begin to improve from near record low levels, as mobility increases (retail sales 
are currently 12% below trend). 
3
In Japan, valuations are attractive (30% of companies trading below book value) on a long-term structural 
basis and the economy is about half way through the growth slowdown. The weak yen has improved 
competitiveness for Japanese products and services. Despite the recent strengthening, the yen is still 
extremely cheap at 40% below its average real effective exchange rate. 
4
From a valuation perspective, Asia looks attractive as P/E is down approximately 60% vs. 'just' 40% in the 
U.S. Overall earnings are flat in Asia, but China credit growth has turned positive, which likely means the 
rest of Asia will soon follow. Revisions too are now turning positive.
5
However, geopolitical risks remain an overhang across the region and as such necessitate an added risk 
premium when thinking about returns. Aligning with long-term government objectives, particularly in 
China, remains important.
Section II: Key Macro Inputs
U.S.
 
Rates
In our view, Fed policy in 2023 will be defined by how the 
FOMC balances two competing imperatives: 1) cooling what 
remains an overheated labor market, versus 2) managing the 
potential adverse impacts of further tightening on the housing 
market, which is already showing overt signs of weakness. 
On the one hand, the U.S. worker shortage is getting worse 
on a secular basis, in our view, which means that the Fed will 
likely need to deliver more tightening over the course of this 
cycle than markets currently expect. On the other hand, we 
do not think the housing market can tolerate short-term rates 
holding above five percent on a sustained basis. 
Our base case envisions the Fed 'threading the needle' 
between these two constraints, with rates rising modestly 
in the near term, but then staying higher for longer as 
policymakers seek to contain inflationary impulses in the 
labor market. We think this approach would be consistent 
with Chairman Powell's recent comment that policymakers 
are focused on effecting 'persistent moves', rather than 
'short-term moves', in financial conditions.
Specifically, we see the Fed hiking rates to the low five per-
cent range next year before cutting slightly as inflation and 
GDP slow heading into year-end. More precisely, we forecast 
short rates peaking out at 5.125% in 2Q23 and ending 4Q23 
at 4.875%. Thereafter, our base case envisions the Fed's 
policy rate drifting toward a higher resting 'neutral' level, hit-
ting 4.125% at year-end 2024 and 3.375% at year-end 2025 
before settling around 3.125% in 2026 and beyond.
How do we arrive at these forecasts? Our models suggest 
that fed funds holding above the low five percent range on a

sustained basis would push mortgage rates into the mid-
seven percent range - which is above the seven percent 
threshold that our proprietary KKR 2022 Homebuyer Survey 
indicated would lead most active homebuyers to abandon 
their searches. Mortgage rates at that level would also put 
more pressure on housing affordability, which is already at 
a 40-year low 
(Exhibit 44)
. In that scenario, we think that 
homebuyers stepping back from the market would flow 
through into materially lower home prices and weaker 
consumer balance sheets, increasing the risk of a more 
jarring U.S. economic downturn. As such, housing market 
dynamics imply a 5.125% 'speed limit' for fed funds this 
cycle, we believe.
On the other hand, we think that the Fed is increasingly 
concerned about what Chairman Powell called a 'structural 
labor shortage' putting sustained downward pressure on 
U.S. unemployment, as a demographics-driven slowdown 
limits the number of young people joining the labor force, 
while the effects of early retirements during COVID continue 
to impact the availability of older workers. Said differently, 
it seems likely that U.S. wage growth has experienced a 
level-shift higher during the pandemic, which means that the 
Fed will need to hold rates higher for longer to meet its dual 
mandate of low unemployment and low inflation, in our view. 
That aligns with our analysis in 
Exhibit 46
, which suggests 
that the Fed will need to hold rates near five percent through 
late 2023 in order to bring inflation closer to its two percent 
target.
If we are right, then the good news is that the 'fat tails' of 
much higher or much lower rates are narrowing. However, 
there are still serious upside risks to consider, particularly 
for the next 12-18 months. To capture these risks, we have 
built a detailed scenario analysis for our deal teams. One 
can see this in 
Exhibit 43
, which shows that we still see a 
cumulative 35% chance that the Fed raises rates to the high-
five percent range next year (i.e., higher than our base case 
of 5.125%, which we assign 55% weighting). We believe a 
more aggressive Fed tightening cycle could occur either: 
1. 
Because the relationship between housing markets and 
interest rates is weaker than we expect and higher rates 
are required to cool inflation (our 'High' case); or 
2. 
Because the Fed overtightens in the near-term and is 
then forced to cut as the housing market deteriorates 
(our 'Overshoot' case). 
Both of these risks demand serious consideration, which is 
why we encourage investors to hedge exposure to higher 
rates in the near term if possible. Importantly, though, our 
framework suggests that upside risks to our base case should 
diminish over time, particularly as the lagged effects of bal-
ance sheet policy begin to play out in the real economy. As a 
result, the term premium on U.S. bonds, which compensates 
investors for longer-term uncertainty, should diminish, too.

* In our base case, the Fed continues to hike rates 
through mid-year 2023, peaking just above five 
percent and ending the year slightly lower in the 
high four percent range.
* In 2024 and 2025, the Fed has room to cut 
rates modestly in response to falling inflation 
and motivation to do so from a housing-market 
slowdown, but policymakers still ride the brake 
with a higher 'neutral' rate for fed funds at 
3.125% in 2026 and beyond.

Case (15% 
chance)
5.63%

3.13%
* A re-acceleration in inflation and consumer 
inflation expectations lead the Fed to continue 
hiking aggressively in 2023 even as the U.S. 
economic backdrop softens. 
* Ultimately, the Fed hikes too far in a slowing GDP 
environment and is forced to cut aggressively in 
2024 as financial/ economic conditions worsen 
and home prices turn over.
Low Case 
(10% 
chance)
2.88%
2.13%
1.88%

* We assume a worsening recession that cools 
inflation significantly by the end of 2023, with 
services activity falling along with goods.
* In this case, we are wrong about a 'different kind 
of cycle' and return to an environment of secular 
stagnation, with the Fed chasing nominal GDP 
growth lower.
High Case 
(20% 
chance)
5.63%
5.63%
5.13%
4.88%
* Similar to the overshoot case, inflation/ 
employment pick back up next year, and the Fed 
continues to hike aggressively in 2023 to prevent 
a wage-price spiral. 
* Unlike the overshoot case, the housing market 
proves resilient to higher rates and we avoid a 
severe recession, meaning the Fed holds rates 
much higher than markets expect both in the near 
and long run to control very sticky inflation.

Accordingly, at the long end of the curve, my colleagues 
Dave McNellis and Ezra Max think 10-year treasury yields 
will end 2023 at 3.75%, versus 4.25% in our previous 
forecast. Thereafter, we have 10-year yields drifting towards 
3.25% over the longer-term. One can see our forecasted 
progression for long-term rates in 
Exhibit 50
. The key input 
here is our expectation for the term premium to rise toward 
50 basis points in the near term to reflect heightened 
uncertainty around the path of fed funds, before gradually 
drifting toward 20 basis points through 2025 (which is still 
well above the 2010-2020 average of just 1.5 basis points, 
as shown in 
Exhibit 49
). Their call for a higher average term 
premium this cycle reflects several factors, including 1) the 
fact that inflation remains elevated and volatile, 2) the larger 
outstanding stock of U.S. debt, particularly in light of Fed QT, 
and 3) structurally lower investor appetite for duration as a 
'shock absorber' following what has been the worst 60/40 
portfolio performance in roughly 100 years.
So, what's our bottom line? The good news is that we think 
central banks are getting closer to the ultimate peak level of

interest rates this cycle, led by the Fed (
Exhibit 47)
, which 
helps take some of the worst-case scenarios for equity 
multiples off the table. On the other hand, both short rates 
and bond yields will likely remain higher on the other side of 
this hiking cycle than most market participants are used to. 
Said differently, our summary expectation is that the U.S. 
rates outlook will stop being a headwind for markets over 
the next 6-12 months, though we do not envision Fed policy 
becoming a tailwind the way it has in recent cycles. 
European Rates
We see the ECB deposit rate topping out at 3.5% in 2023, 
and then we have it remaining there through the end of 
2024. By contrast, market pricing currently implies a depo 
rate peak at around 3.25% in 2Q23, with the first rate cuts 
in 2Q24. We also believe the 10-year bund yield will rise to 
three percent in 2023 and stay there through 2024. This 
view continues to be an important area of differentiation for 
us, as the consensus for the 10-year bund is for two percent 
at end-2023 and end-2024.
It's important to note that our forecasts imply 50 basis points 
of yield curve inversion from the depo rate to the German 
10-year. This forecast reflects our assumption that the long-
term neutral rate for the depo rate is 2.25%, and that the 
ECB will be forced to cut rates to that level starting in 2025. 
Given this, the 10-year rate is likely to stay below the depo 
rate, but we believe only about 50 basis points below, as 
quantitative tightening will keep upward pressure on rates at 
the long end of the curve.
Importantly, the ECB is also about to begin quantitative 
tightening, or QT, as early as March, as President Lagarde 
guided in the December meeting. QT is particularly 
challenging in Europe, we believe, because there are 19 bond 
markets for the central bank to consider. Some peripheral 
markets, notably Italy, have inherent weaknesses that may 
drive rates there above what the ECB desires for monetary 
policy reasons. Policymakers do have a couple of levers 
under the QT umbrella and will likely not apply QT to the 
ECB's entire bond portfolio at once (likely stopping the 
reinvestment of maturing securities in the Asset Purchase 
Program - representing 60% of the total volume of bonds 
it holds - but continuing to reinvest under the Pandemic 
Emergency Purchase Program - which holds 40% of QE 
bonds).

Bigger picture, regarding ECB policies, there are two 
opposing forces at play: 1) the risk of a de-anchoring of 
inflation expectations (i.e., a cycle in which higher consumer 
expectations become self-fulfilling) and 2) flagging economic 
activity. Importantly, industrial output has held up better 
than feared this year despite higher energy costs, while 
governments have unrolled large, un-targeted fiscal stimulus 
to help protect households. We believe these developments 
will give the hawks the upper hand to enforce a focus on #1, 
and to try to control inflationary concerns by erring on the 
side of more restrictive policy.
In thinking through the upside risks to rates, the key area 
of focus for investors is wage growth. So far, households 
have been taking meaningful real wage cuts amidst surging 
inflation. However, if employees begin to demand wage 
growth well in excess of inflation in 2023, then we would 
expect a strong hawkish reaction from the ECB. On the other 
hand, our dovish scenario rests on a deeper-than-expected 
recession increasing slack in the economy and opening up 
the possibility of medium-term weakness in inflation.
S&P 500
How are we looking at the path forward for the S&P 500? 
We expect a bumpy ride towards our year-end 2023 S&P 
500 price target of 4,150. Our frameworks still point to an 
earnings recession next year, as the full impact from the 
Fed tightening cycle this year is still working its way through 
the economy. Even so, we recommend buying into market 
dislocations that arise in coming months, as risk assets will 
likely start discounting a recovery in 2024 by the second half 
of 2023, in our view. While U.S. large-cap equity valuations 
are not unambiguously cheap, their long-term expected 
returns have already improved significantly since the start 
of the year (to six to seven percent per annum from one to 
two percent in December 2021). In addition, our analysis 
of significant market breaks since 1940 suggests that 
investors with patient capital are generally rewarded over the 
next three to five years for leaning into dislocations of the 
magnitude we have seen this year (
Exhibits 3 
and

Our Base Case (50% probability): 
We assume a central 
bank-induced U.S. recession - albeit a modest one - leads 
to a 10% earnings decline in 2023 (with EPS falling to $200 
per share), which we think is an outcome that the market has 
not yet fully digested, particularly given that the bottom-up 
consensus still expects plus four percent growth. Key to our 
thinking is the following:
1. 
Increasing conviction that the ISM manufacturing index 
will fall further into contraction territory next year 
(
Exhibit 58
). 
2. 
The typical post-war earnings decline during mild U.S. 
GDP recessions has been around 10% on average (
Exhibit 
59
).
3. 
With 30 year fixed mortgage rates having risen above six 
percent from a low of around three percent in late 2021, 
home purchase affordability has deteriorated at a record 
rate. As such, we expect housing-related economic 
activity--which accounts for roughly 20% of U.S. GDP--
to slow significantly next year.

INSIGHTS: OUTLOOK FOR 2023: KEEP IT SIMPLE
From a fundamental perspective, we expect margins to come 
under pressure as a sharp slowdown in nominal GDP growth 
is likely to coincide with sticky wage inflation and weaker 
labor productivity (
Exhibit 60
). This backdrop, we believe, will 
limit how much companies can continually raise prices to 
offset elevated input cost pressures. Moreover, as we have 
been highlighting for some time, our Earnings Growth Lead 
Indicator (EGLI) suggests that earnings will be challenged 
in 2023. In fact, as 
Exhibit 62
 shows, our forecast for -10% 
earnings growth in 2023 is actually less aggressive than 
the model, given our view that the energy input might be 
overstated.
Against this backdrop, we are publishing our 'official' price 
target for the S&P 500 of 4,150 for 2023 and 4,390 for 
2024. 
Included in these forecasts are target multiples of 
17.7x for 2023 and 17.3x for 2024, respectively
. To be 
sure, these targets represent only moderate upside from 
current trading levels. However, we do not think investors 
should expect a raging equity bull market under almost any 
scenario in the current macro regime, which now reflects a 
combination of higher real interest rates, more competitive 
yields on Credit and Real Assets, and a Federal Reserve that 
remains comfortable with tighter financial conditions, given 
stickier and more volatile inflation. All these factors will 
continue to keep a lid on valuation multiples, in our view.

We also augment our base case with probabilistic bear and 
bull cases 
(
see 
Exhibit 55) 
to account for the more volatile 
macro environment:
Our Bear Case (35% probability) 
assumes that an 
aggressive hiking cycle drives the U.S. economy and the 
housing market into a more severe economic recession. The 
Fed is unable to pivot and keeps the terminal rate higher 
for longer owing to un-anchored inflation expectations and 
persistent realized inflation. Corporate margins collapse to 
10-year lows, driving an 18% earnings decline in 2023. In 
the face an elevated risk premium and a higher discount 
rate, the S&P 500 fair value would be closer to 3,050-3,100 
in 2023 and 2024, which is in-line with prior bear market 
troughs of 14-15x NTM P/E -
Exhibit 61
.
Our Bull Case (15% probability) 
assumes that inflation 
eases faster than expected, allowing the Fed to engineer a 
soft landing for the U.S. economy. Robust household balance 
sheets prop up consumer spending, while an acceleration 
in re-shoring activity boosts investment and productivity. 
Corporate margins stay near highs, with earnings growing 
approximately five percent in 2023, helping to drive a swift 
decline in the equity risk premium. Under this scenario, the 
S&P 500 could rally back towards 4,730 by end-2023 and 
new highs of 5,060 by end-2024 (consistent with 18-19x 
NTM P/E).
So, our bottom line is that Equities, as measured by the 
S&P 500, represents modest value in today's market. By 
comparison, small cap stocks and Credit appear much more 
attractive. See SECTION III for more details on relative value. 
That said, for longer-term investors, we think that 25% 
or more corrections, which we recently just experienced, 
should be bought, not sold, and as such, we continue to 
advocate for steady deployment throughout 2023, especially 
if we are right that markets become choppy during earnings 
season in the first half of the year.

As we look towards 2023, our expectation is that more 
volatility lies ahead, as we transition from the adverse 
impact of inflation on multiples towards its negative impact 
on earnings growth, margins in particular. Interestingly, as 
we looked to forecast earnings for 2023, our fundamental, 
historical and quantitative approaches all suggested around 
a 10% decline in earnings. The good news, however, is that, 
with the market having sold off meaningfully in 2022, we 
think the current environment actually provides an attractive 
entry point for long-term investors. Moreover, there is also 
a relative game to play too. Specifically, we see a significant 
opportunity for allocators to invest behind companies with

INSIGHTS: OUTLOOK FOR 2023: KEEP IT SIMPLE
Oil
Even amidst fundamental headwinds related to slowing 
economic growth, a strong dollar, and shifting consumer 
behavior in response to high prices (e.g., U.S. gasoline 
demand has dipped down to levels last seen in the immediate 
aftermath of pandemic lockdowns in 2H20), we remain 
constructive on the outlook for energy and energy-related 
investments in 2023 and longer term. As shown in 
Exhibit 
65
, we look for an average WTI crude price of $82.50 in 
2023 and $80 over the longer term in 2024-26. These 
estimates are well above futures strip pricing, which embeds 
$72 on average in 2023 and around $65 over the longer 
term.
Looking at the details, global crude inventories remain 
notably lean (
Exhibit 66
), which leaves the market without a 
good buffer against a number of upside risks for oil in 2023. 
These upside risks include 1) potential shortfalls of Russian 
supply related to EU embargoes; and 2) potential outruns 
of oil demand if global jet fuel consumption (which remains 
around two million barrels per day below 2019 levels) and/
or Chinese demand (which is still about one million barrels 
per day below peak levels) come back more quickly than 
expected. These risks loom at a time when little swing supply 
is available, given that OPEC is already producing near peak 
capacity, and the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve has fallen 
to the lowest levels in 40 years on a demand-adjusted basis.
Exhibit 65
We See Upside to Futures Pricing for 2023, and Think Long-Term Average Prices May Now Run Closer to $80, vs. $50-
60 Pre-Pandemic

Latest forecasts as of December 8, 2022. Prior as of November 1, 2022. Forecasts represent full-year average price expectations.
Our bottom line for 2023 is that we think WTI crude 
continues in a wide and volatile trading range, but one that 
skews higher than the $72 average currently embedded 
in market pricing. Overall, we expect pricing to oscillate 
between $70-110, averaging around $82.50. We view $70 as 
a near-term support level, as OPEC seems inclined to defend 
this price, and because the Biden administration has also 
committed to prop up global demand by refilling the SPR at 
around this level. These factors create important support at 
a level we might otherwise think the market could breach,

given what remains a fundamentally weak backdrop for 
demand 
(Exhibit 67)
. Meanwhile, we use $110 as the high end 
of our range, because that is a typical level for oil at times of 
lean inventories and geopolitical-related risks such as those 
discussed earlier. $110+ is also an approximate level where 
we see more pronounced demand destruction risks.

Looking beyond 2023, we think of $80 as being the 'new' 
mid-point of the long-term trading range for oil, up from the 
approximate $50-60 range that generally prevailed in the 
pre-pandemic era. What has changed, in our view, is that 
the marginal cost of U.S. shale production - which we think 
remains the key driver of incremental global supply - has 
shifted higher. We see several factors driving this structural 
shift, including: 1) a higher cost of capital, given uncertainty 
around how the energy transition will shape regulation 
and long-term demand, 2) a higher cost of drilling, given 
scarcities of equipment and labor, and 3) a higher premium 
placed by the market on firms that return capital versus 
reinvest it.

Given these considerations, we now see U.S. oil production 
running well below what one would normally expect in the 
recent elevated environment for crude prices 
(Exhibit 68
). 
We see this as having constructive implications for energy 
and energy-related equities, which in many cases continue 
to price at double-digit free cash flow yields that look 
sustainable as long as oil can hold in the constructive range 
that we envision.
Looking beyond 2023, we think of 
$80 as being the 'new' mid-point 
of the long-term trading range for 
oil, up from the approximate $50-
60 range that generally prevailed 
in the pre-pandemic era. What has 
changed, in our view, is that the 
marginal cost of U.S. shale pro-
duction has shifted higher.

Section III: Our Most Asked Questions 
Question #1: How are you thinking about relative value, 
including Credit versus Equities? 
In recent months we have spent a lot of time as a team 
alongside our portfolio managers looking at relative value 
across both Equities and Credit. Overall, our models tell us 
that now is the time to begin to lean into risk assets. Indeed, 
as we show in 
Exhibits 70
 and 
71
, a fair amount of bad news 
has been priced into markets unless one thinks a 2008-style 
banking collapse is imminent. We don't see that type of 
de-leveraging, and as result, we are suggesting going from 
a 'jog' to even a 'run' in terms of deployment by the end of 
2023.

Credit again now
more attractive
Data as at December 2, 2022, Source: Bloomberg.
Importantly, though, as we start picking up the pace towards 
increased deployment, we favor being a lender at first. Said 
differently, our models today suggest Credit is the better buy 
at current levels, especially if an allocator has the ability to 
build a broad-based portfolio across both private and public 
markets.
We see several factors at work. First, many large bank 
lenders are 'hung' with loans, which is preventing them from 
extending credit as much as in the past. Second, tighter 
capital standards by regulators and higher loan loss reserves 
are forcing financial institutions to hold more capital and 
issue fewer loans. Additionally, after the Fed and other 
central banks bought up a huge amount of government 
issuance as part of their pandemic-era QE programs, things 
are starting to move in reverse, with government securities 
displacing riskier debt on bank balance sheets. All of these

INSIGHTS: OUTLOOK FOR 2023: KEEP IT SIMPLE
Against this backdrop, it feels like a pretty good time to build 
positions across 1) Private Credit, as unlevered returns are 
now in the low double digits; 2) Liquid Credit, given the 
convexity the asset class offers at current levels. We have 
heard pushback that spreads need to widen a lot more to 
make the opportunity as attractive as it was in the past. We 
don't necessarily agree, as the issue this time is inflation. 
As a result, the risk-free rate, which we view as the proper 
mechanism for capturing higher than expected inflation 
trends, has increased materially. For spreads to widen in an 
inflationary environment, we would generally need to see 
some deterioration in corporate margins (particularly when 
the term structure of corporate debt looks relatively benign). 
That would make it unlikely that we see spreads widening 
without nominal GDP slowing sharply and risk-free rates 
falling simultaneously. Said differently, we think that yields 
today are at quite attractive levels, which have historically 
made good entry points for longer-term investors.

Importantly, within Credit, we are espousing our Keep It 
Simple thesis. Said differently, we prefer moving up in 
the capital structure, keeping duration in check, and not 
stretching on leverage. To this end, we favor the highest 
quality CLO AAA liabilities, senior Direct Lending, and some 
High Yield. One can see this in 
Exhibit 76
. We also continue 
to like collateral linked to nominal GDP growth, including 
e.g. Real Estate Credit. Importantly, given the different 
convexities of the products (i.e., HY is trading at a material 
discount to par), we think that a multi-asset class Credit 
solution, including both private and liquid securities, could 
make a lot of sense in the macroeconomic environment we 
are envisioning.
Importantly, within Credit, we 
are espousing our Keep It Simple

Meanwhile, we are seeing similar themes take place in Real 
Estate Credit. Ongoing volatility has caused a pullback in 
large sources of real estate debt financing, including banks 
and the CMBS market. Many debt funds and mortgage 
REITs are on the sidelines due to the inability to source 
cost efficient financing. This backdrop has created an 
opportunity for those with available capital to move up the 
capital structure and lend on high-quality assets owned by 
top institutional sponsors and located in growth markets at 
attractive all-in yields, lower leverage levels, and with more 
protective covenants. 
To be sure, even though overall Credit as an asset class looks 
more attractive in relative terms, we also see emerging value 
in Equities. We are particularly cognizant of the fact that 
the Russell 2000, which is where many large-cap buyout 
firms play, looks attractively priced relative to large-cap U.S. 
equities. In fact, we believe that small caps will finally begin 
to outperform the S&P 500.

In terms of sector preferences across Equity indexes, we 
like Energy as a structural long against Technology, as the 
index weightings rebalance over the next few years. Our 
work shows that when sectors become larger than 20% of 
the S&P 500, they tend to lag. One can see this in 
Exhibit 
80,
 which shows the collective underperformance that began 
for Energy in the early 1980s, Technology in 2000, and 
Financials starting in 2007. Beyond Energy, we also believe 
that Industrials and large cap Pharmaceuticals will perform 
well on both an absolute and relative basis 
(Exhibit 79)
.
Looking at the bigger picture, we think that now is the time to 
diversify more across asset classes. Central to our thinking is 
that we are leaving a period of low growth and low inflation 
in favor of lower real GDP and higher nominal GDP, albeit 
with more volatility. If we are right, then 
Exhibit 81 
represents 
an excellent way of discerning pockets of value. In our view, 
we think asset allocators should be overweight Small Cap 
Equities, Mortgages, High Yield, high quality CLO liabilities, 
and opportunistic Private Capital.

Question #2: Do you think we are still in a regime change, 
given the recent improvement in U.S. inflation? 
Since the onset of COVID, we have been talking about a 
different kind of recovery, or a different regime that would 
require a new approach to asset allocation. Key to our 
thinking has been that volatile inflation would impede central 
banks' ability to step in and provide ample support during 
periods of dislocation. Importantly, in this current cycle, 
demand-side inflation, which many investors are used to 
seeing, would actually be super-ceded by supply-driven 
inflation. We note the following supply-side constraints: 
1. 
The energy transition is actually inflationary
, as it 
requires many hard to find inputs in volatile parts of the 
world, while most of the processing of these commodities 
occurs in China, which provides its own unique set of 
challenges. Cobalt, for example, is mined in scale in the 
Congo, while most of the Manganese in the world comes 
from South Africa. Moreover, fully 65% of the total global 
refining of such commodities, including lithium (72%), 
cobalt (71%), and manganese (99%) is now done in 
China.
2. 
Geopolitics creates supply chain headwinds
, requiring 
redundancies that are structurally more inflationary in 
nature, as the world becomes less globally integrated. 
In fact, since we last wrote about this topic in our 
midyear outlook, we have seen more examples of major 
companies building out duplicate supply chains with an 
eye toward geopolitical risks, rather than focusing solely 
on manufacturing costs. All told, in 2022 U.S. companies

3. 
Labor shortages, especially in the developed markets, 
fuel faster wage growth than in the past. 
In the U.S., for 
example, our research suggests that the labor shortage 
will get worse - not better - in coming years, amidst a 
backdrop of lower participation for older workers and a 
demographic slowdown impacting the number of younger 
workers. The latest employment data confirm these 
trends, as the participation rate for 25-54 year olds is 
back near pre-pandemic levels, despite companies still 
having to pay out materially to retain workers. 
4. 
Lack of housing supply and rental properties in a 
period of accelerating household formation could 
lead to upward pressure on inflationary inputs
. While 
home price appreciation has slowed of late, there is still 
a considerable mismatch between the supply of new 
homes and the number of new households that have 
been formed since the GFC. Somewhat perversely, higher 
rates hurt, rather than help, the housing supply issue that 
we have been identifying. As a result, we still see annual 
rental costs, which account for nearly one third of CPI, 
remaining stubbornly high well into 2023.

Geopolitics creates supply chain 
headwinds, requiring redundancies 
that are structurally more 
inflationary in nature, as the world 
becomes less globally integrated. 
We have seen more examples 
of major companies building out 
duplicate supply chains with an 
eye toward geopolitical risks, 
rather than focusing solely on 
manufacturing costs.

Our bottom line: While we do think that cyclical inflation 
peaked in late 2022, we still believe that we will land at a 
higher resting heart rate for inflation this cycle. As such, the 
underlying structural inflationary dynamics created by the 
aforementioned four considerations will continue to constrain 
the ability of central banks to ease policy quickly. Consistent 
with this view, Chairman Powell in late December said that 
he does not see the Fed loosening policy until inflation is 
""definitely on track to again hit two percent."" Said differently, 
from a tactical investment perspective, we do expect the 
outperformance of Value stocks, collateral based cash flows 
(e.g., Infrastructure), and Commodities to continue in 2023, 
just not to the same degree. In fact, given how badly bonds 
performed over the past year, we are now less concerned 
about being long duration than we were in 2022. 
However, beyond the tactical bounce that a slowdown in the 
pace of inflation could create, our longer-term outlook for 
the economy and markets reinforces our view that it is not 
business as usual. To this end, our conversations with CIOs 
suggest that investors will still need to add more Real Assets 
to their portfolios this cycle to protect against the regime 
change that we are forecasting. They may also need more 
floating rate debt in their portfolio, and they may want to 
overweight more flexible capital that can lean into periodic 
dislocations. Maybe most importantly, we think that the 
recent positive correlation between stocks and bonds will 
continue, which likely means that Equities and Fixed Income 
will continue to sell off together in response to periodic bouts 
of inflation. In this environment, all else equal, 2023 is a time 
to keep it simple and own more assets that are positively 
linked to nominal GDP growth. See 
Question #8 
for more 
details on what this means for portfolio construction.

Question #3: What indicators help us determine a bottom 
on overall risk positioning?
As we referenced earlier, we think that history suggests that 
both Equities - after falling 25% -- and Credit -- especially 
when it trades at 85 cents on the dollar or cheaper -- appear 
attractive from a valuation perspective. One can see this in 
Exhibits 3
 and 
4
, respectively.
However, we also understand that many investors want 
specific signposts for when to structurally lean in. To be 
sure, there is no absolute certainty around timing; each cycle 
is different based on monetary policy, growth dynamics, and 
inflationary trends. That said, there are some pretty standard 
indicators that my colleague Brian Leung and the team often 
watch. They are as follows:
Key Indicator #1: A Bottoming in the ISM
 As we show in 
Exhibit 87
, the year-over-year performance in the S&P 500 
and the ISM manufacturing index are very tightly linked. To 
review, the ISM measures the change in production levels 
across the U.S. economy from month to month, and it is 
released the first day of the month to indicate the level of 
demand for products by measuring the amount of ordering 
activity at the nation's factories. According to Brian, our best 
estimate is that it will trough this cycle in the low 40s around 
mid-2023. One can see this in 
Exhibit 87.

Key Indicator #2: Markets Tend to Bottom in the Middle, Not 
the End, of Recessions 
As we discussed in our economics 
section, we expect the economies of the developed world, 
the U.S. in particular, to be in a recession for much of 2023. 
However, we do see light at the end of the tunnel as we head 
into 2024. To this end, we roughly approximate that the 'mid-
dle' of the recession we anticipate could be in the spring or 
summer of 2023. Importantly, given that equity markets and 
bond markets have sold off dramatically in advance of this 
potential event, we would rather be early than late on adding 
risk. This viewpoint is consistent with our thesis to not wait 
until the end of recessions to start to add back risks to one's 
portfolio (
Exhibit 88
). There are three factors that lead us to 
believe that 2023 will not be a prolonged, 2008-type down-
turn. For starters, we do not think the banks need to de-lever

the same way they did during the GFC. Second, while we 
think housing activity will slow, we are not forecasting any 
serious impairments to home equity. Finally, we think that 
unemployment will not surge the way it did during the Great 
Recession. In fact, labor is in short supply this cycle, which is 
one of the unique features of the downturn we expect.

Key Indicator 
#3: 
The Fed Stops Tightening
 
There is the old 
adage 'Don't Fight the Fed.' That viewpoint is particularly 
true, we believe, when the Fed is raising rates in 75 basis 
point increments. Hence, our decision to 'walk, not run,' 
in 2022 made sense. However, as one can see in 
Exhibit 
89
, market bottoms tend to occur when the Fed slows 
its hawkish campaigns. Though this cycle may be a little 
different, given the Federal Reserve's sizeable balance sheet, 
we do not think it changes the message. As such, given that 
we have the Fed finishing its tightening campaign at 5.125% 
in 1H23, with cuts potentially starting by the end of the year, 
we think investors should be adding risk to their portfolios by 
mid-2023.
Key Indicator 
#4: 
Buy six to nine months ahead of a bottom 
in earnings estimates
 Conventional wisdom is that markets 
bottom when the earnings slate is clean, and as one analyst 
put it to me, 'forward earnings actually look achievable.' 
Our work, however, shows that bear market lows usually 
occur 6-9 months 
ahead 
of earnings reaching their lowest 
point. One can see this in 
Exhibit 90
. So, while we do think 
that earnings forecasts still look far too optimistic, if we are

right that earnings will bottom by the end of 2023 before 
recovering in 2024, then the signal from EPS may actually 
be to 'buy' sometime in the middle of next year.
So, when we pull all our indicators together to assess this 
cycle, we feel that earnings and the behavior of the Federal 
Reserve are probably the signals to overweight. Key to 
our thinking is that we are transitioning from the markets 
re-pricing worse than expected inflation towards a period 
where inflation's adverse effects dent corporate profits and 
consumer balance sheets. As such, we need to be right that 
1) inflation is actually peaking and the Fed has some wiggle 
room to slow its historic tightening campaign; and 2) this 
economic downturn is more akin to the shallow recession of 
2001 than the harsh economic pullback of 2008.
Regardless of our short-term timing indicators, we also want 
to underscore that leaning in when markets have recently 
dropped 25% or more probably makes a lot of sense. One 
can see this in 
Exhibit 91
, which looks back to other periods 
when the market sold off 25% or more dating back to 1940. 
To be sure, every cycle is different, but our bottom line is 
that long-term investors should lean into dislocations in the 
beginning of 2023.

Question #4: Can you talk about the path of inflation and 
what it means?
As we have written about for quite some time, we view the 
current inflationary impulse as different because it is not 
just demand driven. Rather, we see structural supply driven 
headwinds, including the energy transition being inflationary, 
demographics driving tighter labor markets, and intensifying 
geopolitical dislocations causing unwelcome periodic price 
distortions.

Importantly, the last time that we had a similar backdrop 
was the 1970s. To this end, we have spent a lot of time as a 
team trying to discern 'lessons learned' for investors from 
that era. From our vantage point, one of the most important 
conclusions is that, as we show in 
Exhibit 94
, both the level 
and the rate of change in inflation matter. Specifically, after 
inflation reached surprisingly high levels in the early 1970s, 
markets rallied sharply as it came back down towards more 
manageable levels for a period of time. 
This insight is important to us because, while we still do 
worry that inflation is at high levels, our team has increasing 
conviction that inflation has definitively peaked. Specifically, 
our forecasts show CPI cooling from 8.0% in 2022 to 
3.9% in 2023. This viewpoint is also consistent with our 
proprietary core inflation indicator, which we show in 
Exhibit 96
.
This insight is important to 
us because, while we still do 
worry that inflation is at high 
levels, our team has increasing 
conviction that inflation has 
definitively peaked.

What's driving the decline in our model? The biggest single 
disinflationary impulse right now is coming from the goods 
sector, where input costs and supply chain pressures are 
easing against a backdrop of slowing consumer demand. 
At the same time, the lagged effects of monetary and fiscal 
tightening are beginning to show up in the real economy, 
with M2 money growth slowing precipitously, while medium-
term consumer inflation expectations have started to cool at 
the margins. Finally, although rental inflation remains very 
high, our leading housing market data suggests that it has 
stopped accelerating. All of these data points indicate that 
inflation will continue to cool in coming months. In turn, we 
have higher conviction that the Fed will be able to step back 
from its tightening campaign by the middle of next year, 
which will bring more sustainable relief to equity multiples.

That said, we still think that the high overall 
level
 of inflation 
will remain a concern over the course of this cycle, driven 
first and foremost by wages. Notably, our leading indicator 
for wages has not cooled off yet, and our forecasts show 
average hourly earnings at about 4.4% over the next 
three years, versus overall inflation of 3.0%. Maybe more 
importantly, 
our long-term analysis suggests that the 
U.S. labor shortfall will only become more entrenched 
in the economy over the next decade, as we shift from 
a participation-related shortage of older workers during 
COVID to a demographics-related shortage of younger 
workers in coming years
. This tension is a big deal, and 
it will put more pressure on margins, particularly in labor-
sensitive sectors like Healthcare, Retail, and Leisure and 
Hospitality.
So, what's our bottom line? We think that markets are 
transitioning from pricing in the impact of rising headline 
inflation on front-end rates and multiples, to pricing in the 
impact of high wage inflation on earnings. From a top-down 
view, that is a bullish signal, given that valuations tend to 
bottom out before earnings. However, it also means that we 
still think this cycle will punish business models that lack 
defendable margins and a clear ability to pass through higher 
input costs. It also leads us to continue to think that investors 
need more real assets and up-front/collateral-based cash 
flows in their portfolios.

Question #5: How are you thinking about allocating the 
international markets?
For quite some time, allocating to non-U.S. markets within 
the liquid securities segment of most portfolios has been 
an inferior strategy from a performance perspective. In the 
last five years, for instance, the performance differential 
between the U.S. and other equity markets has been on the 
order of 900-1100 basis points, as one can see in 
Exhibit 
100
. Why have non-U.S. equity markets underperformed? 
On the one hand, a combination of sluggish earnings growth, 
valuation compression, and a rising U.S. dollar collectively 
has served as headwinds to international market returns. At 
the same time, the S&P 500 has enjoyed significant growth 
in Technology sector earnings, which has led to margin and 
multiple expansion for the entire index in recent years. All 
told, Technology hit 29% of the S&P 500 in 2021, compared 
to 21% at year-end 2016 and 19% at year-end 2011.

As we look ahead, however, we think that the performance 
differential has become too extreme and is now likely to 
narrow. As such, we are beginning to get more interested 
in non-U.S. listed Public Equities, including many parts of 
South East Asia. In particular, our proprietary KKR EM/DM 
model is suggesting that the difference between valuations 
in the emerging markets and the developed markets, the U.S. 
in particular, has gotten too wide. One can see this in 
Exhibit 
101.
 
To be sure, other important model inputs such as ROE, FX, 
and momentum continue to signal a more cautious stance. 
The good news is that if we are right about the U.S. dollar 
continuing to cool in 2023 and beyond, then FX should 
switch from a negative to a positive; when that happens, 
momentum could turn positive, too, which should create a 
constructive backdrop for rising ROE stories in our view. So, 
while we do not want to lead the leading indicator too much, 
we are certainly getting more intrigued by the set up for 
select parts of the public emerging markets arena.

In Europe, we see a similar narrative. On an absolute basis, 
focusing on 12-month forward P/E, most European sectors 
appear quite attractive. Moreover, in relative terms, almost 
all of them are also trading on a lower multiple versus U.S 
peers, and when compared to the last ten years. One can 
see this in 
Exhibit 103
. That's the good news. The bad news, 
however, is that - as Aidan Corcoran has been highlighting 
- there is still likely to be heavy downward pressure on 
European earnings estimates in early 2023.

So, what is our bottom line? Our call to arms for 2023 is 
that we see a tactical value trade to get long international 
Public Equities where we have confidence in the earnings 
backdrop, including both parts of Europe and select parts of 
the Emerging Markets. The dollar's reversal will be crucial 
for our thesis to play out in 2023. 
However, we do not want to confuse the tactical with the 
strategic. Without question, our long-term bias in overseas 
markets remains to compound capital via International 
Private Equity. Central to our thinking is that Private Equity 
portfolios are better equipped to gain exposure to compelling 
secular growth trends, many of which are still not always 
available in the public markets (
Exhibit 108
).
In Asia, for example, we think that Private Equity is much 
better positioned than Public Equities to capture direct expo-

sure to the rising middle class. Gaining access to this cohort 
is critical, we believe, as Asian consumers are entering the 
prime age to start families, buy homes, expand healthcare 
usage, and save more. Moreover, we are increasingly struck 
by how fast overall consumer behavior patterns are changing 
in the region as demographic shifts combine with new tech-
nology (e.g., e-commerce) and urbanization trends 
(Exhibit 
105)
. All told, we now forecast the Asian consumer market to 
surpass the U.S. during the next few years. One can see this 
in 
Exhibit 104
. However, Consumer Discretionary accounts 
for just three percent of the CSI 300 Index in China, versus 
10% of the S&P 500.
We also note that technology and innovation, two major areas 
of focus for KKR's Private Equity deal teams, are massively 
underrepresented in many Asian countries' public markets 
at the expense of state-owned Financials (see 
Exhibit 107
, 
showing that Technology accounts for 0% of the MSCI 
Indonesia index).

Europe is obviously a very different demographic opportunity, 
but in many instances, European Private Equity firms have 
been able to gain more targeted exposure to sectors like 
Technology, Media, and Communications. Indeed - despite 
all the geopolitical crosscurrents of late - our meetings 
on the ground in Paris, London and Madrid over the last 
twelve months has confirmed the robust opportunity for 
our local teams with thoughtful entrepreneurs and growing 
family businesses that see value in partnering with Private 
Equity. By contrast, Europe's public markets offer far less 
exposure to growth sectors such as Software, Security, and 
Digitalization, which collectively comprise less than 10% 
of many high profile public equity indexes in the region. In 
fact, nearly 60% of the Eurostoxx index is concentrated in 
Financials, Industrials, and Real Estate at a time when rising 
energy input costs, central bank rate hikes, and a slowing 
global goods economy are putting more pressure on these 
sectors. That backdrop has allowed Private Equity to deliver 
superior absolute and relative performance, as one can see

So, our bottom line is that weak currencies and attractive 
valuations make public international markets more 
interesting than in the past. Moreover, with positioning 
extremely light, we think that a growing handful of European 
and Asia 
public
 markets could surprise nicely to the upside 
in 2023. That is the tactical opportunity we see, especially if 
the U.S. dollar weakens a bit more than consensus expects. 
Maybe more important, though, is the fact that key growth 
trends may not always be well represented in traditional 
public indexes in international markets. Therein lies the 
true strategic opportunity, we believe, for thoughtful CIOs 
to embrace investment vehicles such as Private Equity that 
actually gain sizeable, long-term exposure to these themes in 
order to drive returns well above the tactical opportunity we 
now see in the public international equity markets.
Question #6: What is your outlook for the U.S. consumer, 
wages, and housing?
In our midyear outlook, we described a bifurcation between 
U.S. consumers' incomes and their balance sheets, with 
real wage growth turning negative for most households 
amid higher costs for essentials such as gasoline, and 
transportation. That call was, unfortunately, the right one.
Going forward, the good news is that - despite higher 
costs for food and shelter - consumers' income statements 
may actually improve
 in 2023, with real income growth 
flipping from negative to positive amidst cooling inflation 
and higher wages 
(
Exhibits 109
 and 
110
)
. 
Said differently, 
despite our call for a recession in the U.S. next year, we 
expect the labor market to hold up far better than in recent 
downturns 
(Exhibit 23)
. Key to our thinking is the unique 
combination of cyclical
 
and structural forces putting upward 
pressure on U.S. nominal wages this cycle, including a 
record number of job openings needing to be backfilled as a 
result of COVID-era retirements (
Exhibit 83
) and a worsening 
shortage of younger workers in services professions as a 
result of slowing demographic growth. If we are right, then 
the surprise of 2023 might be that consumers actually have 
more
 real spending power than they did in 2022, particularly 
as households' overall debt servicing costs remain quite low 
coming out of the pandemic

On the other hand, where we do see more signs of emerging 
risk is on the balance sheet side of the equation. Remember 
that the central bank-induced run-up in financial asset and 
real estate prices has served as major tailwind for higher-
income consumer spending in recent years. Just consider 
that the average U.S. house appreciated $61,000 in 2021, 
nearly as much as the median household income of $71,000. 
Those dynamics are now starting to cool and in some cases 
reverse amidst a sharp correction in capital markets and an 
ongoing HPA slowdown, raising the possibility that fading 
wealth effects will offset improving real incomes and result 
in a downturn in U.S. consumer spending. That possibility 
is particularly concerning because balance sheets tend 
to mostly help high-end consumers, who account for the 
majority of U.S. consumer spending.

So, amidst these cross currents, how do we see U.S. 
consumer spending playing out? On balance, we think that 
declining household net worth is likely to cause a 2001-2003 
style 'slowdown' in consumer spending. However, we are 
not forecasting a GFC-style 'collapse', given resilient housing 
fundamentals, consumer cash balances and the ongoing 
normalization of services spending.
For starters, on housing, my colleagues Paula Campbell-
Roberts and Patrycja Koszykowska recently reviewed their 
outlook for the U.S. housing market. Their key takeaway was 
that, even with higher mortgage rates, home prices continue 
to benefit from a 
fundamentally constructive backdrop
 related 
to demographic-driven demand amidst a chronic undersupply 
of housing 
(Exhibits 114 
and
 115)
. Specifically, Millennials 
- the largest generation of Americans - are entering first-
time home-buying age at a time when the supply of existing 
single-family homes for sale remain near all-time lows. In 
fact, the cumulative gap between new households formed 
compared to new housing starts since 2009 is on the order 
of 2.1 million, and the supply of existing homes is being 
constrained both by higher mortgage rates and by increased 
longevity of existing homeowners. As a result, while we do 
think that U.S. home prices will experience low single-digit 
year-over-year declines in coming years, housing wealth 
should still settle close to or above 2019 levels, providing a 
key support to consumer confidence and spending.

This backdrop likely means 
that the consumer slowdown 
we're anticipating will be largely 
concentrated in the Goods 
sector, rather than in Services. 
This viewpoint is important as 
services dwarf goods in the 
economy by 2:1.

Second, we would point out that 
consumers are still 
holding a 
lot 
more cash than they were at the start of the 
pandemic. 
The top four income quintiles - who collectively 
account for 91% of consumer spending in the U.S. - have 
seen their cash holdings balloon since 2019. In fact, the 
increase in checkable deposits is so extreme that the second, 
third and fourth quintile each holds more cash today than 
the quintile above it did pre-pandemic 
(Exhibit 116)
. At an 
aggregate level, U.S. consumers now have nearly $5 trillion 
in their bank accounts, compared to approximately $1 trillion 
pre-pandemic, a 4.9x increase. To be sure, the savings rate 
as a percentage of disposable income has fallen to 3.1% from 
a peak of 33.8% during the pandemic, but our view is that 
there is still a lot of cash flowing around the system 
(Exhibit 
111)
. In short, U.S. households are still sitting on plenty of 'dry 
powder' that will support spending, we believe.
Third, as we wrote earlier, we continue to think that 
consumption will increasingly shift from above-trend goods 
spending to below-trend services spending as the effects 
of stay-at-home COVID policies fade. This backdrop likely 
means that the consumer slowdown we're anticipating will 
be largely concentrated in the Goods sector, rather than in 
Services. This viewpoint is important as services dwarf 
goods in the economy by 2:1. Moreover, within services, a 
lot of categories that were considered 'discretionary' in past 
recessions are increasingly becoming 'new essentials', with 
a stronger outlook for categories like omni-channel retail, 
personal care, ESG, home repair, and auto maintenance than 
one might see in a 'typical' recession.

So, our bottom line is that amidst high inflation, higher 
interest rates and falling household net worth, the overall 
consumer picture in 2023 is definitely negative but not 
disastrous. However, within the consumer economy, we do 
expect a notable divergence. Specifically, while companies 
with defendable margins should hold up reasonably well this 
cycle, the corollary is that the 'hit' to consumer spending 
will disproportionately fall on durable goods companies and 
services companies with uncontrolled labor costs. 
Question #7: What are your thoughts on expected returns 
this cycle?
We recently reviewed return assumptions across asset 
classes in both public and private markets. See 
Exhibit 119 
below for details, but our main takeaways were as follows:
1. 
Fixed income returns should be higher than they 
were last cycle. 
Higher projected Investment Grade 
and High Yield returns reflect, first and foremost, the 
math of higher coupons in a world where we think 
bond yields settle in the 3-3.5% range. While corporate 
defaults are likely to rise from today's ultra-low levels, 
the combination of higher nominal GDP growth and 
companies having termed out their debt during the 
pandemic should help keep credit losses relatively tame 
compared to past cycles. Meanwhile, while we think 
credit spreads may widen modestly, a sharp move would 
probably require a drastic slowdown in growth, which 
would in turn provoke a dovish pivot in Fed policy, too; 
said differently, we assign a small probability to an 
outcome in which 
both 
spreads widen 
and 
risk-free rates 
stay really high.
2. 
Large-cap U.S. equity returns will likely be lower. 
One 
consequence of our call for treasury yields to stay higher 
this cycle is that P/E ratios have only limited scope to 
re-rate from today's levels. If we are right - and we 
think we are - then earnings growth, rather than multiple 
expansion, will drive the bulk of S&P 500 returns 
over the next five years. The good news is that even 
accounting for a near-term EPS downturn, strong overall 
nominal GDP growth should translate into mid-high 
single digit returns for large-cap U.S. equities. Though 
it is lower than what investors are used to from the last 
five years, that return profile aligns with the fundamental 
signal from our top-down five-year real returns model, 
which has a good track record of predicting real equity 
market returns from simple macro variables 
(Exhibit 125). 
 
Importantly, we are actually 
more
 constructive on both 
U.S. small-cap and certain non-U.S. stocks relative to the 
last cycle. Top of mind for us is that small-cap multiples 
have de-rated much more than large-cap multiples 
(Russell 2000 P/E is roughly two standard deviations 
below its long-run average, versus S&P 500 P/E near 
its long-run average), while a peak in Fed hawkishness 
should be a tailwind for foreign-currency assets. Outside 
of the U.S., we caution that investors need to pick the 
right

markets in countries like like Indonesia are actually 
overweight large financials, and at the same time, have 
very little exposure to rising GDP-per-capita stories in 
their public markets. 
3. 
Real Assets remain an asset class of choice. 
No 
question, the cash flows from Real Assets become 
more appealing in an environment of higher nominal 
GDP growth. That thesis has been the backbone of 
our decision to overweight collateral-based cash flows 
in recent years. To be sure, we acknowledge that the 
performance of Real Estate and Infrastructure returns 
may slow relative to the last five years, which reflects 
first and foremost the fact that nominal GDP, while still 
quite elevated, is slowing. Nonetheless, we continue 
to think that Real Assets, especially Infrastructure, 
Energy, and Real Estate Credit, should be a larger part 
of investors' portfolios in a world where real interest 
rates - even after a historic rate tightening campaign 
- remain relatively low. They are also an important 
'shock absorber' if we are right that stocks and bonds 
will continue to sell off together (i.e., are now positively 
correlated) during bouts of rising inflation.
4. 
The illiquidity premium will become more important 
amidst heightened volatility. 
Even after inflation peaks, 
we think that the 
threat
 of higher inflation will present 
a new constraint on global monetary policy relative to 
the last twenty years. This new reality will limit central 
banks' abilities to smooth fluctuations in markets, and 
increase volatility across rates, FX, and real GDP growth 
relative to past cycles. Against this backdrop, we think 
that there is more value in the illiquidity premium than 
there was during the post-GFC era 
(Exhibit 18),
 with alpha 
becoming a more important contribution relative to beta 
in private market returns.

The bottom line for us is that investors will need a different 
playbook relative to what 'worked' during the last five 
years. Within public markets, leaning into large-cap U.S. 
Equities at the expense of everything else may not deliver 
the same results as it did in the past. In particular, we see 
better performance for Credit and for small-cap and non-
U.S. equities. We also think that a larger illiquidity premium 
will emerge in private markets. We also see both the return 
profile of and the diversification provided by Real Assets 
remaining an important driver of portfolio performance 
in the coming years. Perhaps most importantly, we think 
that investors will need to take a more 
holistic
 approach to 
portfolio construction relative to past cycles, as many of 
the familiar relationships between asset-level returns have 
shifted in a world of high inflation and more restrictive 
interest rate policy.
Against this backdrop, we think 
that there is more value in the 
illiquidity premium than there 
was during the post-GFC era.

Question #8. What is your latest view of the 60/40 
portfolio?
For some years, we have argued that from an asset 
allocation and portfolio diversification perspective, 
quantitative easing likely overstated the importance of bonds 
as both income producers as well as 'shock absorbers.' In 
May 2022, Racim Allouani, who heads our Global Portfolio 
Construction Group at KKR, and Thibaud Monmirel, a 
colleague on Racim's team, began to pound the table harder 
on this call as quantitative tightening accelerated, changing 
the underlying characteristics of existing portfolios. At 
that time, we published an 
Insight
s note 
Regime Change: 
Enhancing the 'Traditional' Portfolio,
 that made the case 
that the traditional 60/40 allocation wasn't providing the 
same benefits to a balanced portfolio as in the past. As 
an alternative, we suggested considering an increase in 
allocations to more inflation resilient assets such as Private 
Credit, Infrastructure and Real Estate in a '40/30/30' 
Equities/Bonds/Alternatives construct. 
The bottom line for us is that 
investors will need a different 
playbook relative to what 
'worked' during the last five 
years. Within public markets, 
leaning into large-cap U.S. 
Equities at the expense of 
everything else may not deliver 
the same results as it did in the 
past. In particular, we see better 
performance for Credit and for 
small-cap and non U.S. equities. 
We also think that a larger 
illiquidity premium will emerge in 
private markets.

Shifting a portion of the portfolio to

Meanwhile, the remaining traditional bonds 
allocation still allows for some convexity if 
inflation does cool in 2023.

Importantly, today we are not as adamant that the 
performance of the 60/40 is at risk, given that this 
benchmark portfolio has experienced its worst performance 
in 100+ years. One can see this in 
Exhibit 121
. Said 
differently, a tactical rally may be in store, especially if we 
are right in our forecast that the U.S. 10-year yield peaked 
in 2022. However, our long-term viewpoint around portfolio 
construction is unchanged. Specifically, we continue 
to believe that, in the new macroeconomic regime we 
have entered, there are better ways to improve portfolio 
diversification and overall risk-adjusted returns beyond what 
the traditional 60/40 can provide, including our '40/30/30' 
portfolio.

60/40 Portfolio: Key Investing Conclusions
1
While the 60/40 portfolio could snap back in the short-term, our fundamental, long-term view that the 
correlation between Equities and Bonds has turned positive has not changed. As such, we think we are in 
a different regime for asset allocation. 
2
We reiterate our view that a 40/30/30 Equities-Bonds-Alternatives allocation offers more robustness 
around diversification and inflation protection for the macroeconomic environment ahead. In the follow-up 
to our May 2022 portfolio construction paper, we examine our suggested 10% allocation to Private Credit. 
3
We think that the case for Private Credit is actually more compelling today than when we wrote our 
original piece in May 2022. This asset class is benefitting from traditional lenders being sidelined, as 
capital charges mount amidst a large amount of 'hung' loans. We also see improved lending terms, higher 
absolute rates, and larger companies.
4
While building this 10% Private Credit allocation (which in general takes a few years) we propose 
investors pay attention to the current value offered in traded credit. We see some compelling relative value 
in CLO liabilities for example, which can be used as a bridge to get to the 10% Private Credit allocation. 
5
Institutional and individual investors may look for different ways to implement our views. Draw-down 
funds remain compelling options for institutions and high net worth individuals, but we also see some 
compelling tactical opportunities across BDCs, interval funds, and even some high quality ETFs. 
So, as we look ahead, we think that long-term investors 
should not rush back into the 60/40 simply based on 
performance. Rather, we continue to advocate for some 
form of a more diversified portfolio, including our 40/30/30 
portfolio framework. There are several considerations 
that we think are worth highlighting to investors. Most 
importantly, though, is that we maintain high conviction that 
the traditional stock-bond correlation will remain challenged 
over the next 5-7 years. Key to our thinking is that we will 
have a higher resting heart rate for inflation as well as our 
belief that larger fiscal deficits will persist in developed 
economies. Finally, we see Quantitative Tightening as a 
headwind to the role bonds played in portfolios during the 
last decade or so.
These insights are hugely important, as the bedrock of the 
60/40 allocation is the negative correlation between stocks 
and bonds, allowing Bonds to cushion Equity losses when 
they occur. As numerous studies have shown and as we 
have witnessed first-hand this year, higher levels of and 
uncertainty around inflation play a major role in pushing the 
stock-bond correlation higher. And as we outline in Question 
#2 above, even though we think that inflation will cool in 
2023, we believe that the stock-bond correlation won't return 
to the levels of the past two decades given the structurally 
inflationary risks that the pandemic has highlighted. Simply 
relying on bonds to hedge equity holdings in this new macro 
regime we envision is a suboptimal stance, in our view. 
Instead, we believe that investors will need to use more of 
the tools at their disposal to increase the robustness of their 
portfolio diversification in the challenging macroeconomic 
environment ahead (

INSIGHTS: OUTLOOK FOR 2023: KEEP IT SIMPLE
Section IV: Conclusion
Truth tends to reveal its highest wisdom in the guise of 
simplicity
. 

 Friedrich Nietzsche, German philosopher 
As we peer around the corner to what lies ahead in the 
global capital markets, we are poised - despite some of 
the significant cross-currents that we see across the 
global economy - to enter 2023 with a more constructive 
tilt. Our basic premise is that it will be easier to navigate 
inflation's negative impact on corporate earnings and 
consumer balance sheets in 2023 than it was to invest with 
inflation consistently surprising central banks and investors 
throughout all of 2022.
However, making money in 2023 and beyond will not be 
easy. It will require both patience and courage, and it will 
require an investor to have a game plan that leverages the 
type of long-term frameworks that we employ at KKR across 
asset classes and regions.
In terms of deployment preferences, our message is 
straightforward: Keep It Simple. We have exited TINA (there 
is no alternative), and as such, one does not need to stretch 
to make an adequate total return. In terms of where we 
would lean in, we favor a few things:
1. 
We retain our bullish bent on collateral-based cash 
flows
. Infrastructure, Real Estate Credit, and many parts 
of Asset-Based Finance look extremely attractive to us 
right now. We also like what these types of investments 
do to a portfolio during a higher interest rate, higher 
inflation, and higher nominal GDP environment. Most 
importantly, they provide both income and diversification.
2. 
In today's market we heavily favor a 'solution' of 
different Credit products
 
that can provide both above 
average yield relative to recent history and some 
convexity if inflation is peaking
. Said differently, we like 
the high absolute yield and floating rate nature of Private 
Credit today, but we also like the convexity that Liquid 
Credit, including High Yield, can potentially provide if 
rates increases cool. 
3. 
While overall Equity returns are coming down, we think 
that there is a significant opportunity in small caps. We 
also like dividend-growing 'aristocratic' equities that 
have good capital allocators as CEOs
. Within Private 
Equity, we believe strongly in companies with simple unit 
economics and modest leverage. Cash flow conversion, 
not big TAMs (total addressable markets) will be the key 
attribute in this new macroeconomic environment we 
envision. 
Importantly, though, across all these asset classes, 
our 
message is to keep it simple
, including moving higher up 
in the capital structure when possible, not over-extending 
on duration, and focusing on quality. Consistent with this 
view, we think the reality that many banks are no longer 
extending credit as freely means that it is a good time to fill 
that gap and be a lender to high quality counterparties. And 
within Credit, the good news is that all the dislocations that 
occurred in 2022 have now created a large number of cost 
of capital arbitrages that favor investors who understand 
relative value. 
In today's market we heavily fa-
vor a 'solution' of different Credit 
products that can provide both 
above average yield relative to re-
cent history and some convexity if 
inflation is peaking. Said different-
ly, we like the high absolute yield 
and floating rate nature of Private 
Credit today, but we also like the 
convexity that Liquid Credit, in-
cluding High Yield, can potentially 
provide if rates increases cool.

In terms of where we could be wrong on our outlook, our 
biggest concern is that wage growth keeps the Fed in action 
for longer than we expect, including the reduction of its 
balance sheet 
(Exhibit 126)
. To compensate for this scenario, 
we continue to advocate for more floating rate debt in the 
portfolio as well as a large overweight to Real Assets.
In closing, we approach 2023 with guarded optimism. 
We feel confident that the global capital markets - in 
their currently unsettled state - are providing some very 
interesting opportunities to investors who understand 
relative value, and in doing so, know how to invest into 
some of the cost of capital arbitrages that we are seeing 
across asset classes and regions these days. Importantly, 
we believe that it will be the marriage of a steady, top down 
framework 

 coupled with sound bottom-up fundamental 
analysis 

 that will win the day. Along the way, though, we 
must remember that simplicity likely trumps complexity in 
a world of higher rates, stickier inflation, and heightened 
geopolitical tensions.
Consistent with this view, we 
think the reality that many banks 
are no longer extending credit as 
freely means that it is a good time 
to fill that gap and be a lender to 
high quality counterparties. And 
within Credit, the good news is 
that all the dislocations that oc-
curred in 2022 have now created 
a large number of cost of capital 
arbitrages that favor investors 
who understand relative value.
