Aggressive Now, Pause Later 
The minutes from the June meeting of 
the Federal Open Market Committee 
didn't contain a ton of surprises. The 
central bank is worried that if it doesn't 
aggressively remove monetary policy 
accommodation, inflation could 
become entrenched. Participants judged 
a 50- or 75-basis point rate hike at the 
July meeting would be appropriate. The 
minutes are dated, and inflation 
expectations have dropped recently 
along with commodity prices. Still, the 
incoming data on consumer prices 
could determine if it is a 50- or 75-basis 
point rate hike. The minutes noted that 
policy would need to be even more 
restrictive.  
Since the minutes, market-based 
measures of inflation expectations have 
dropped and are consistent with where 
the Fed would want them. Also, the 
jump in the University of Michigan's measure of inflation expectations, which spooked 
the Fed, has been revised away. The June CPI will likely determine how aggressive the Fed 
is this month. Our preliminary forecast is for the CPI to have risen 1.1% between May and 
June. This would be the second consecutive monthly gain of at least 1%.  
There were a few references to tighter financial market conditions, which are doing some 
of the work for the Fed. Monetary policy primarily affects the economy via financial 
market conditions. Therefore, the Fed is getting exactly what it wants: lower stock prices, 
higher Treasury yields, and wider corporate bond spreads 
Pause is possible 
The front-loading of rate hikes gives the Fed the flexibility to pause, which the minutes 
alluded to. Once the target range for the fed funds rate is at its neutral rate of 2.5%, the 
Fed may pause to assess how the removal of monetary policy is affecting the economy, 
inflation and the outlook.

Fed officials don't seem concerned about a recession. There 
was no reference to recession in the minutes. Also, the Fed 
described the labor market as very tight. The minutes did 
highlight some downside risks to the outlook, including 
further tightening in financial market conditions that would 
be a larger drag on the economy. This is a subtle sign that 
the Fed has financial market conditions roughly where it 
would like them and further tightening could concern the 
central bank. 
Fed gives shout out to GDI 
The Fed didn't avoid discussing the drop in first-quarter GDP 
and the prospect that it didn't do well in the second quarter. 
However, the minutes referenced gross domestic income, 
which has held up better than GDP. 
 
The difference between real GDP and real GDI, also known 
as the statistical discrepancy, has never been so large. The 
Bureau of Economic Analysis, the government agency that 
constructs these estimates, may be having an especially 
difficult time accurately measuring real GDP in the 
pandemic given the resulting big swings in global trade and 
inventories. If so, the BEA could ultimately revise GDP up to 
be more consistent with real GDI. It is also possible that the 
BEA is overstating corporate profits. The strength of GDI is 
likely one reason the Fed doesn't seem concerned about a 
recession.  
High-yield spreads will widen further 
U.S. high-yield corporate bond spreads have widened 
noticeably this year and likely have not peaked as the 
economy continues to cool and volatility in equity markets 
remains above historical averages. The current high-yield 
corporate bond spread would put the odds of a recession at 
33%. This would potentially be a reason for optimism, since 
the credit cycle normally leads the economic cycle. 
However, the investment-grade corporate bond spreads put 
the recession odds at 52%. 
For now, volatility isn't out of line with economic 
fundamentals. To estimate the level of the VIX consistent 
with fundamentals, we model the monthly average of the 
VIX using an ordinary least squares regression. Independent 
variables include the GDP-weighted average of the ISM 
surveys, financial market stress, a dummy variable for 
recessions, and U.S. economic policy uncertainty. 
The results were in line with our a priori, as all coefficients 
had the expected sign. All were statistically significant and 
had an adjusted r-squared of 0.62. The regression was re-
estimated, but we replaced U.S. economic policy uncertainty 
with global policy uncertainty. The assumption is that 
uncertainty abroad would affect volatility in U.S. equity 
markets. However, the results showed this explained less of 
the variation in the VIX than U.S. policy uncertainty. 
Overall, the VIX isn't out of line with fundamentals, so the 
widening in spreads for high-yield corporate bonds shouldn't 
be surprising. A model we built to forecast high-yield 
corporate bond spreads uses the ISM surveys, and odds are 
that they will decline further, implying further widening in 
the spreads. The high-yield corporate bond spread is 
currently 583 basis points, more than an average spread of 
350 basis points outside of a recession. 
Spreads are still noticeably tighter than the 1,000-point 
average spread during the past three recessions. The 
baseline forecast doesn't assume a recession, therefore 
spreads shouldn't come anywhere close to the average seen 
over the past three recessions. Though U.S. GDP could 
decline in the first half of this year, other data don't signal a 
recession, including the ISM manufacturing and 
nonmanufacturing surveys. 
Both of the ISM surveys declined in June, but neither are 
near levels that have historically signaled a recession. The 
GDP-weighted average of the ISM surveys tracks financial 
market conditions. Financial market stress so far in July 
points to further ISM survey declines, though they would 
not be as significant as in prior months. There is still some 
cushion as the GDP-weighted average of the ISM surveys 
remains above its neutral threshold of 50.

TOP OF MIND 
Is Emerging Market Inflation Peaking? 
BY JESSE ROGERS
Large trade and current account surpluses have been a 
bubble wrap-like barrier for emerging economies, but fresh 
routs in emerging market currency, bond and equity markets 
are tearing at the padding. With fast-rising interest rates in 
both advanced and emerging economies stacking the deck 
against the emerging world, our call for most emerging 
economies to grow this year may seem foolhardy. But we 
stand with our cards firmly on the table. This is because 
inflation in most emerging economies has already peaked or 
will do so by summer's end, with falling food and energy 
prices pulling inflation lower. 
This does not mean that price pressures will fully recede. 
While falling global food and energy prices will allow 
emerging market central banks to ease off the pedal, the 
cost of food staples, gasoline, and consumer-related services 
will remain elevated. This means that while most emerging 
economies will avoid recession, it certainly won't feel like it 
with elevated unemployment and still-large holes in 
incomes. 
Calling inflation's peak 
The next few inflation prints will mark the peak for inflation 
in the emerging world; by late summer year-on-year price 
gains will begin to ease. Most large economies in Latin 
America saw inflation budge a little in May--
in 
Brazil
 and 
Colombia
 the pace of inflation actually 
decreased. We expect this pattern to play out in emerging 
Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, where inflation has been 
later to rise due to a combination of fuel subsidies and a 
period of falling food prices in Asia 
following 
Chinese
 farmers' near-three-year battle with swine 
flu. Things could take longer in emerging Europe, where 
labor markets are tighter and expectations of higher prices 
are more entrenched. 
Two forces will work in conjunction to reduce price 
pressures. The first is the broader decline in commodity 
prices. This owes partly to the anticipation of a better wheat 
harvest in 
Australia
, a bumper corn crop in 
Argentina
 and 
Brazil, and of another large soybean harvest in the U.S., and 
partly to commitments by global energy producers to raise 
crude oil production. 
Also helping things is that by now, emerging economies 
highly dependent on food and energy imports 
from 
Ukraine
 and 
Russia
 have secured new supplies or found 
their way to discounts.  
 
The second force is a more aggressive Federal Reserve, 
which has pushed up the dollar and reduced growth 
expectations. That in turn has pushed down inflation 
expectations and commodity prices. Because most 
commodities are priced in dollars, a stronger dollar tends to 
put downward pressure on prices. 
There is little disagreement that commodity prices are now 
past their peak, and that action by the Fed and other major 
central banks will work to push them even lower. But there 
is less of a consensus that inflation in emerging markets will 
fall in kind. This is because of fears that inflation 
expectations have become perniciously ingrained in Latin 
America, Africa, and parts of emerging Europe and the 
Middle East. However, these concerns are based largely on 
the past experience of high and hyperinflation in these 
regions and ignores the fact that price pressures are not 
finding their way into wages. 
What's needed to send inflation back up is a feedback loop 
between higher prices and demands for higher wages, 
known as a wage-price spiral. But growth in nominal wages 
in most emerging economies has so far been outpaced by 
inflation. This is the case in Latin America, where average 
real monthly pay is some 15% below the pre-pandemic 
peak, and in emerging Europe. The little wage data there is 
in Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Middle East points to this 
also being the case. The reason is that labor markets have 
yet to fully heal from the pandemic's blunt-force blow, 
robbing workers of the bargaining power they would need to 
push wages higher. 
What about core? 
Analysts are right to note that higher food and energy prices 
have spilled into the cost of other goods, pushing measures 
of core inflation--that is, inflation excluding food and 
energy--above central bank targets. But this is because food 
  
 
MOODY'S ANALYTICS

and energy commodities are also key inputs into the 
broader basket of consumer goods and services. As these 
commodity prices fall, overall inflation will ease, putting less 
pressure on emerging market central banks to step on the 
gas and paving the way for growth to continue. 
The price of unrest 
That commodity prices will continue to move lower does 
not make up for the fact that today and tomorrow, they 
remain uncomfortably high. Take wheat, the commodity 
most shaken by Russia's invasion of Ukraine after oil--and 
one that is also critically important to the global economy. 
Amid anticipation of better harvests in Australia and faster 
tightening by the Fed, prices have fallen by almost half from 
all-time highs set earlier this year. But at $9 per bushel, 
wheat prices are still well above the average recorded during 
the 2004-2014 commodities boom. 
Food insecurity has stoked resentment in wheat-
hungry 
Egypt
, Turkey and 
South Africa
, and will be a thorn in 
the side of the frail recovery in other emerging economies. 
Frustration with rising living costs has propelled populist 
leaders to victory in recent presidential elections in 
Chile
, 
Colombia, 
Peru
 and the 
Philippines
 and has shaken up the 
political landscape in 
Turkey
. While there is little chance 
that new leaders will fundamentally alter the economic 
landscape in the near term, they will face pressure to 
counter higher living costs with budget-busting subsidies. 
And things could get worse. The last time food prices were 
this high, social protests erupted across the emerging world, 
culminating in the Arab Spring and in protest movements in 
China and Iran. Today's political climate is even more 
volatile, the product of a decade of stagnation in most 
emerging economies and the prolonged blow from the 
COVID-19 pandemic. There is little patience for the kinds of 
changes that would get emerging economies moving again, 
mostly because they are less visible to ordinary voters and 
the payoff is down the road. 
A harder landing to stick 
We are confident that our call for emerging markets to grow 
this year is the right one, while remaining well aware that 
what's in store can hardly be called good growth, at least 
not of the kind needed to boost jobs and bolster incomes. 
We also caution that higher growth rates--especially in 
emerging Asia and the Middle East--are largely an illusion. 
Higher growth figures in 
India
 and Southeast Asia are largely 
a consequence of their bouts with the Delta and Omicron 
waves of the COVID-19 pandemic and the delayed recovery 
relative to the rest of the emerging world. 
The Middle East is the sole emerging region where higher 
commodity prices will do more good than harm. But higher 
growth rates are largely a function of a faster-growing 
population rather than a rise in living standards. Like the rest 
of the emerging world, productivity has barely risen in the 
last decade, something that is dead evident in Latin America 
and most other emerging regions. 
 
Things should not be this way. Textbook economics teaches 
that in a globalized economy, firms will exploit differences in 
wages and production costs to pad profits, driving faster 
economic growth along the way. This is the story of 21st-
century China, but the rest of the emerging world has been 
less able to latch on. Despite calls to re-shore supply chains, 
China's dominance of global manufacturing will budge 
little--firms and workers in China are just too good at what 
they do. To grow and prosper, emerging economies will 
instead need to raise educational attainment, integrate the 
informal economy, and cultivate high-value-added services. 
This is a much harder landing to stick.

The Week Ahead in the Global Economy 
 
U.S.  
The U.S. economic calendar is busy next week and could 
determine whether the Federal Reserve raises the fed funds 
rate by 50 or 75 basis points at its meeting this month. The 
key will be the June consumer price index, which likely will 
rise by more than 1% for June because of a jump in retail 
gasoline prices. Excluding food and energy, the early 
consensus is for the CPI to have risen 0.6%, matching the 
increase in May. On a year-ago basis, the CPI will be up 
around 8.9% in June compared with 8.6% in May. We also 
get the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey, 
and the Fed is very sensitive to inflation expectations.  
 
Also, we'll get new data on producer and import prices. 
Once the CPI and PPI are released, we will have a good idea 
what the PCE deflator did in June. Other key data include 
retail sales, industrial production, the NFIB small business 
optimism index, and business inventories.  
 
Europe  
The U.K.'s GDP likely inched lower by 0.1% m/m in May, 
deepening the 0.3% decline in April. Surging inflation likely 
weighed on appetite to spend, while supply shortages likely 
continued to thwart output. Indeed, the country's PMI 
reading nosedived to 53.1 in May from 58.2 in the previous 
month.  
 
Meanwhile, we expect that the euro zone's industrial output 
picked up by 0.4% m/m this May, the same as in April. 
Germany and Ireland's manufacturing sectors likely propped 
up the aggregate as those out of France and Spain were 
lackluster. Supply conditions evidently eased enough to 
allow output in the transport equipment sectors to recover 
during the month. Unfortunately, future conditions are not 
yet secured. 
 
We do not expect any surprises from the final readings of 
next week's CPI releases. In Germany, we expect the 
inflation rate to have slowed to 7.6% y/y in June from 7.9% 
in May; in Spain we expect the rate jumped to 10.2% from 
8.7%; in France it was likely up at 5.8% from 5.2%; and in 
Italy, inflation likely rose to 8% from 6.8%. We suspect a 
significant decrease in transport service prices in Germany, 
thanks to policies introduced to ease the cost of living, was 
one of the main reasons Germany's inflation rate decreased. 
 
Finally, the euro zone's external trade balance likely reported 
another significant deficit in May. We anticipate a deficit of 
EUR33.3 billion for May, slightly worse than the prior month's 
EUR32.4 billion deficit. Imports likely continued to grow at a 
much quicker pace than exports. Oil and gas will continue to 
supercharge imports while exports are being weighed down 
by tight supply and weaker demand from abroad, namely 
China amidst that country's COVID-19 lockdowns.  
 
Asia-Pacific
 
China's economic data barrage will be a highlight on the 
economic calendar. We expect the annual decline in retail 
trade to have moderated in June as aggressive movement 
controls that were a notable dampener on April data eased. 
Industrial production likely picked up modestly in the same 
month. Mining, manufacturing and utilities all improved in 
May, led by energy-related industries; this should repeat in 
June. Manufacturing and nonmanufacturing PMI data 
support our view that goods and services industries 
continued mending last month. 
China's GDP growth likely moderated to 3.8% y/y in the 
second quarter from 4.8% in the March quarter, reflecting 
lockdowns and other pandemic-related controls in several 
large cities early in the period. 
Central banks in New Zealand and South Korea are likely to 
lift benchmark rates by 50 basis points at their July policy 
meetings. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is trying to 
anchor long-term inflation expectations. Demand-pull 
pressures are running beyond comfort levels and have 
pushed wage growth to a multiyear high. A 50-basis point 
increase would lift the official cash rate to 2.5% and take 
cumulative hiking this tightening cycle to 225 basis points. 
The Bank of Korea is contending with inflation that soared 
well beyond comfort levels in June to 6% y/y, its highest in 
almost 24 years. A 50-basis point hike would take BoK's 
policy rate to 2.25%. 
Households in New Zealand and South Korea are relatively 
highly leveraged, making them sensitive to aggressive rises 
in borrowing costs. Higher lending rates as well as elevated 
prices for nondiscretionary items such as food will put more 
pressure on consumption in those markets.

In the week ended July 1, US$-denominated high-yield 
issuance totaled $0.788 billion. This brings the year-to-date 
total to $98.2 billion. Investment-grade bond issuance 
totaled $11.5 billion in the same week. This brings its year-
to-date total to $805.8 billion. Issuance is still tracking that 
seen in 2018 and 2019.  
U.S. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK 
There were some tweaks to the U.S. baseline forecast in 
June, but the changes were smaller than in prior months. 
The new baseline forecast factors in the recent tightening in 
financial market conditions, increases in energy prices, and 
new data on first-quarter GDP. 
Fiscal assumptions 
The federal budget deficit will fall from 12.4% of GDP in 
fiscal 2021 to 4.4% this year and 3.8% the next year. This 
improvement largely reflects the end of federal pandemic 
relief and a stronger economy. In the June baseline, the 
effective personal tax rate was adjusted higher in the near to 
medium term. The U.S. Treasury Department enjoyed a 
better-than-expected windfall of individual income taxes in 
April thanks to soaring asset prices and widening 
participation in equity markets in 2021. Nevertheless, this is 
coming at the expense of personal savings. A higher tax bill 
has led to a faster decumulation of excess personal savings 
than previously thought. 
In its second estimate of first-quarter GDP, the Bureau of 
Economic Analysis revised personal current taxes to reflect 
the stronger-than-anticipated filing season and lower 
refunds, which shaved a full percentage point off the savings 
rate in the first three months of the year. As a result, excess 
savings are decumulating at an accelerating rate, though 
they remain prodigiously above $2.5 trillion. Because of 
incoming data and fiscal changes to the forecast, the savings 
rate will average 1.1 and 0.7 percentage point lower in 2022 
and 2023 compared with the May baseline. 
COVID-19 assumptions 
Changes to our epidemiological assumptions were 
noticeable, but the economic implications are modest as 
each wave of COVID-19 has a diminishing effect on the 
economy. Total confirmed COVID-19 cases in the U.S. will 
be 97.07 million, compared with 88.5 million. The seven-
day moving average of daily confirmed cases has been 
steadily rising since the May baseline and is now 122,000, 
more than double that seen when we updated the May 
baseline forecast. 
We're sticking with the concept of ""effective immunity,"" 
which is a rolling number of infections plus vaccinations to 
account for the fact that immunity is not permanent. The 
forecast still assumes that COVID-19 will be endemic and 
seasonal. 
Energy price assumptions 
The European Union's sixth set of economic sanctions 
against Russia will create the biggest disruption to the global 
oil market since the Yom Kippur War. Though a strong vote 
of confidence in Ukraine, the move will stoke inflation, raise 
consumer energy bills, and complicate global central banks' 
task of raising interest rates without tipping their respective 
economies into recession. 
The baseline forecast now has West Texas Intermediate 
crude oil prices peaking higher than in the prior baseline 
forecast. However, the timing hasn't changed, and the 
forecast assumes oil prices peak this quarter, averaging $107 
per barrel. The contours of the forecast haven't changed, 
and the June baseline still has oil prices steadily declining in 
the second half of this year and throughout next year, 
approaching $60 per barrel in late 2024. 
Nudging GDP lower 
Real GDP is expected to increase 2.7% this year, compared 
with 2.8% in the prior baseline. We have cut our forecast for 
U.S. GDP growth this year by a total of 80 basis points over 
the past few months. We nudged the forecast for GDP 
growth in 2023 down from 2.7% to 2.6%. The economy is 
still expected to grow above its potential, which is likely 
between 2% and 2.5%. 
Revisions to first-quarter GDP, which is now shown to have 
declined 1.5% at an annualized rate (previously -1.4%), were 
a small factor in the revision to GDP growth this year. The 
weakness in the first quarter was concentrated in net 
exports and inventories. 
Net exports were an enormous weight on first-quarter GDP. 
Trade has been a consistent weight on GDP growth as 
demand for consumer goods has been robust. The U.S. 
consumer is buying a ton of goods and the majority of these 
are imported. Neither inventories nor trade tell us where the 
economy is headed. 
Declines in GDP during economic expansions have 
happened before. The three contractions in GDP occurring 
between the global financial crisis and the COVID-19 
pandemic occurred because of some combination of a 
widened trade deficit and the quarterly oscillations of the 
inventory build. Consumption, the largest component of 
GDP, did not contract in those instances, nor did it in the 
first quarter of 2022. Consumption, particularly on services, 
accelerated in the quarter. 
Our baseline forecast for real GDP growth this year is close 
to the Bloomberg consensus of 2.6%. The forecast for next 
year is 0.6 percentage point stronger than the Bloomberg 
consensus of 2%.

Business investment and housing 
Incoming data over the past few weeks point toward weaker 
U.S. real business investment in the second quarter. Still, 
growth will be solid and fundamentals, including supportive 
financial market conditions and better after-tax corporate 
profits as a share of nominal GDP, should continue to 
support investment through the rest of this year and into 
next. Another favorable development for business 
investment is that the rate of new-business formations has 
risen recently, tempering concerns that the pandemic could 
have scarring impacts on entrepreneurship. 
We have real business equipment spending rising 6.5% this 
year, compared with 7% in the May baseline. The forecast is 
for real business equipment spending to increase 5.2% in 
2023, compared with 3.9% next year. 
There was a downward revision to housing starts as supply 
constraints and higher mortgage rates have started to bite 
into the housing market. Housing starts are expected to be 
1.77 million compared with 1.83 million in the prior baseline. 
Housing starts are expected to total 1.86 million next year, 
down from 1.89 in the prior baseline. 
There are likely only so many homes that can be built each 
year because of labor-supply constraints and a lack of 
buildable lots. Some of the labor-supply issues will ease as 
the pandemic winds down, but the reduction in immigration 
is particularly problematic for homebuilders' ability to find 
workers. We cut the forecasts for new- and existing-home 
sales this year. They are expected to total 6.59 million, 
lighter than the 6.86 million in the prior forecast. We also 
cut the forecast for total home sales next year. New-home 
sales account for about 10% of total home sales. 
There were minor tweaks to the forecast for the FHFA All-
Transactions House Price Index this year and next. The June 
baseline has it rising 11.3% this year, compared with 12.2% 
in the prior baseline. The forecast for 2023 and 2024 
continues to expect little house price appreciation. 
Labor market 
The U.S. labor market remains strong even as job growth is 
moderating. Trend job growth is between 400,000 and 
450,000 per month, but this isn't sustainable and needs to 
fall to around 150,000 per month later this year or the 
Federal Reserve's attempt to engineer a soft landing will 
become increasingly difficult. 
Nonfarm employment rose by 390,000, on net, in May, 
better than either we or the consensus anticipated. The gain 
leaves nonfarm employment 822,000 below its pre-
pandemic peak. This should be recouped over the next few 
months. However, excluding leisure and hospitality, 
employment is already above its pre-pandemic peak. Of 
course, this doesn't account for the jobs that would have 
been created if the pandemic didn't occur, which is around 5 
million. 
We have job growth averaging 373,000 per month this year, 
nearly identical to the gain in the May baseline forecast. Job 
growth is expected to moderate next year and in 2024. The 
unemployment rate is expected to average around 3.3% in 
the fourth quarter of this year before gradually rising over 
the next couple of years as the effect of tighter monetary 
policy starts to be felt. 
We assume a full-employment economy is one with a 3.5% 
unemployment rate, around a 62.5% labor force 
participation rate, and a prime-age employment-to-
population ratio a little north of 80%. All of these 
conditions will be met this summer. 
Monetary policy 
The minutes from the May meeting of the Federal Open 
Market Committee signal that the central bank wants to 
aggressively hike rates at the next couple of meetings to 
allow officials the potential to pause and assess the effects 
of policy firming on the economy, inflation and financial 
markets. This would improve the odds that the Fed 
engineers a soft landing. Previously, it appeared the Fed was 
going to hike until something broke, either inflation or the 
economy. The minutes were lighter on the inflation 
discussion than in March. On the balance sheet, a number of 
officials supported eventually selling mortgage-backed 
securities. The immediate market reaction to the minutes 
was fairly tame, potentially because there were no big 
surprises, and we didn't make any changes to our near-term 
forecast for the fed funds rate. 
The Fed has begun its quantitative tightening campaign. If 
the Fed sticks with its current plan, its balance sheet will 
decline by about $520 billion this year. This may sound like 
a lot, but the balance sheet will still be massive, around 37% 
of nominal GDP. It was less than 20% of nominal GDP 
before the pandemic. Also, there wasn't a mention of MBS 
sales in  the FOMC's May minutes. 
The 10-year Treasury yield has bounced around recently but 
we didn't make any changes to the baseline forecast. The 
10-year Treasury yield will average 3.14% in the final three 
months. We still have the 10-year Treasury yield averaging 
3.25% in the fourth quarter of next year, identical to the 
May baseline. The June baseline forecast incorporates the 
recent swing in equity prices, which is the reason for the 
revision to the forecast. Equity prices are expected to 
bottom in the first quarter of next year and will resume 
rising in the second quarter.

THE LONG VIEW: EUROPE 
Boris Johnson as Caretaker PM 
BY ROSS CIOFFI 
U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson resigned on Thursday but 
vowed to stay on as a caretaker until a new leader is 
selected. There will be more details about the timetable for 
finding a new prime minister next week. Although Johnson's 
resignation creates a period of additional uncertainty for 
the 
U.K
., we are not making changes to our forecast in 
response to Thursday's news. Whoever takes over will need 
to refocus policy on addressing the key risks to the 
economy, such as the cost-of-living squeeze, and the 
country's longer-term challenges. 
German industry grows 
German
 industrial production expanded 0.2% month on 
month in May, following April's 1.3% growth--an upward 
revision from the initial estimate of 0.7%. However, output 
remains 2.7% below February's level. Excluding energy 
production, manufacturing would have expanded by 0.6%. 
This was supported by a rebound in transport equipment 
production, up 5.5%. Shortages of intermediate products, 
cost pressures, slowing global demand and heightened 
uncertainty weigh on prospects for the manufacturing 
sector in the second half of the year. In June, the 
manufacturing PMI reading dropped by 2.8 points to 52 as 
output and new orders contracted. 
Ireland's
 industrial production rebounded strongly in May, 
increasing by 13.9% month over month, after a 9.6% slump 
in April. Modern industries drove the rebound, surging by 
32.6% and reversing the large 20.4% decline in April. 
Traditional industries boasted a 6.1% increase following two 
months of decline. The same supply and inflation issues are 
creating considerable risks for Irish manufacturing. Indeed, 
this June, the manufacturing PMI dropped to by 3.3 points 
to 53.1, its lowest reading in 16 months. 
The May releases for Ireland and Germany were each 
upbeat, despite the overall uncertainty growing in the 
economy. They will also be the reason industrial output 
likely grew this May at the aggregate level of the euro zone. 
In next week's release, we predict a 0.4% month-on-month 
increase in euro zone industrial production in May. 
Dutch inflation softens in June 
Year-on-year inflation in the 
Netherlands
 decelerated to 
8.6% in June. After peaking at 9.7% in March, a moderation 
in energy's contribution has pushed down the headline rate. 
Inflation pressures will ease in the coming months as base 
effects revert and start pushing down the year-ago 
comparison. Moreover, next month, a 12-point VAT cut on 
energy will drive the headline rate even lower. However, 
natural gas prices have been soaring recently and if they stay 
up, we will see the effect on Dutch inflation figures. Even in 
the case that inflation decelerates, we would still expect 
second-round effects to keep the consumer price index 
growing at a rate that is above target. We expect these 
higher prices to weigh on consumer spending, with prices 
increasing with greater intensity later this year. 
Swiss labour market still going strong 
The situation in 
Switzerland's
 labour market was stable. 
June's unemployment rate remained where it has been since 
February at 2.2%. Construction, retail, and food and 
accommodation services sectors saw significant declines in 
unemployment. Post-lockdown spending this summer is 
supporting economic activity and demand for employment. 
As there are headwinds in the global economy that will 
soften growth later this year, we expect that the 
unemployment rate has likely bottomed out.
