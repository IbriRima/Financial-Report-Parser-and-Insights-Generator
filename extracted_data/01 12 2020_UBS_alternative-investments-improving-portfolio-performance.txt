1. Introduction

“ How are investors adjusting their allocation to alternatives, 

and what are the results? In this paper we will look at 
the size and variety of alternative investment categories, 
expected returns and risk, and how investors can 
incorporate them into their portfolios.“

The last 30 years have seen a steady growth and acceptance 
of alternative asset classes in institutional portfolios as 
investors seek diversified sources of income and return. These 
asset classes are sometimes called illiquid or private asset 
classes because one important characteristic is that they are 
not publicly listed in markets or no active dealer market exists. 
Past success of these asset classes, continuous innovation, 
and the ongoing low interest rate environment are the main 
drivers of this growth.

One way to divide the alternative universe is into private 
capital investments and other strategic investments. Within 
private capital there are real estate, private equity, private 
debt, and infrastructure and natural resource investments. 
The two strategic investment categories that we consider are 
hedge funds and commodities.

The largest sectors of the alternatives world are private equity, 
real estate and hedge funds with private debt gradually 
getting more attention and fund flows. 

One characteristic of alternatives is that these assets classes 
are far more difficult to implement. Except for commodities, 
there are no low-cost index funds. They require higher levels 
of oversight and management than those offered in the public 
markets. Additionally, due to the closed-end nature of many 
of the investments, continuous search costs are necessary, 
thus requiring either sophisticated staffs to build and maintain 
these portfolios or high out-sourcing costs. Hedge funds 
require a high degree of active management both at the fund 
level and the total portfolio level.

How are investors adjusting their allocation to alternatives, 
and what are the results? In this paper we will look at the size 
and variety of alternative investment categories, expected 
returns and risk, and how investors can incorporate them into 
their portfolios.

There are many ways to classify alternatives. Like the public 
markets, there are equity funds and debt funds, but what 
really distinguishes them from the public markets is their 
liquidity, which ranges from illiquid investments requiring a 
years-long commitment to markets with near daily liquidity.

Because of illiquidity, many of these asset classes don't have 
actual transactions to assess short term performance. Instead, 
they rely on net-asset-values (NAVs) based on appraisals, 
which can distort short run performance. For long term 
performance, these asset classes rely on cash flows with 
the traditional measure being the internal-rate-of-return 
(IRR). Other measures such as the Public Market Equivalent 
(PME) are gaining attention. Right now, it is still very difficult 
to obtain good measures of risk in these asset classes to 
compare to traditional asset classes.

Another feature of alternatives is the almost exclusive reliance 
on active management. Commodities are the only alternative 
asset class that can run systematic or passive strategies at low 
cost. This adds on an additional layer of risk in these asset 
classes: manager performance.

By and large, the historic performance of alternatives has been 
in line with expectations with return and risk profiles that 
can help investors build better portfolios. Going forward, we 
expect more muted returns, in part due to the current market 
conditions that we see in the public markets (low interest 
rates and potentially stretched valuations in equities), but also 
because of the enormous amounts of capital that has flown 
into these sectors.

1.1. Who invests in alternatives?
At the institutional level, we see four groups of major 
investors into alternatives: large public funds, endowments, 
growth-oriented sovereign wealth funds and family offices.

The most aggressive users are US university endowments, 
some with allocations as high as 60%. Yale University started 
this trend in the 1980s and is now over 75% invested in 
alternatives. It is the norm to see 40% to 60% allocations 
to alternatives in large endowments. Global family offices 
allocated an average 37% to a variety of alternatives 
according to a recent survey1. Mega funds like large public 
pension plans and sovereign wealth funds typically allocate 
15% to 25% to alternatives and are considering increasing 
their alternatives allocation.

Private (corporate) defined benefit pension plans in the US are 
smaller players in alternatives as they are gradually adopting 
liability-driven investing. In the defined contribution market, 
historically US plans have been negligible players, but recent 
regulation encourages some innovation. Superannuation 
funds in Australia have been more receptive to alternatives, 
but still have very small allocations. In aggregate, the 
insurance market is huge, so even small allocations of 1% 
means they are significant players, but they tend to focus on 
real estate and debt funds and shy away from private equity 
and hedge funds. Statutory reserve requirements in the 
insurance industry make meaningful allocations to alternatives 
problematic for general accounts.

1.2. Market size 
We look at several measures when we estimate the size 
and opportunity set of the alternative market. We have to 
combine various types of data often with different dates and 
some of which will overlap with the public markets (hedge 
funds, for example), and others which are based on fund 
level data, not security level data (which can also overlap with 
market measures).  Thus, getting an estimate of the size of the 
alternative universe is not easy.

First, we look at the public equity and fixed income markets. 
As of June 2020, we estimate the size of the public equity 
market at USD 53 trillion and the fixed income market at 
USD62.9 trillion, which gives a total of about USD116 trillion 
of public assets of debt and equity. Additionally, for December 
2019 we have estimates of USD9.55 trillion of direct real 

estate assets and about USD3.0 trillion held in gold. To this 
opportunity set, we can add the closed-end funds of private 
assets (private equity, private debt, infrastructure and natural 
resources) of about USD4.8 trillion.

Thus, we define the Base Market as the sum of the public 
assets, direct real estate and closed-end funds, which is 
approximately USD134 trillion.

We now add in hedge funds, and open-end real estate 
and commodity funds. But hedge funds are generally 
using existing public assets and real estate funds consist 
of existing real estate investments; thus, we are technically 
double counting the opportunity set when we include them. 
Commodity funds, which we estimate to be about USD250 
billion are another nuance to deal with.

Still we can compare the total size of the alternative 
marketplace of by adding in the Base Market alternatives with 
the hedge funds and commodity funds, and real estate funds.

In aggregate we estimate the size of the alternative market for 
institutional investors to be about USD20.7 trillion or about 
15.5% of the Base Market. Other measures of market size are 
fundraising and committed cash that has not been called (aka 
- dry powder). There is a huge amount of dry powder in this 
segment – USD2.6 trillion. 

Another measure of the market is the amount of fund raising. 
As shown in Exhibit 4, fundraising is highly cyclical, rising 
rapidly in bull markets and dropping in the aftermath of bear 
markets.

Traditionally, the private credit markets consisted of 
mezzanine, distressed debt and real estate mortgages. In 
the last dozen years, the biggest growth in the private debt 
market is in direct lending, driven by post-financial crisis bank 
lending restrictions and attractive returns. It has gone from 
years of below USD1 billion in fundraising in early 2000s to 
years of USD25 billion (peak of USD59 billion in 2017).

1.3  Historic risk and return: 

Alternatives and traditional asset classes

Exhibit 5 presents historical performance statistics of some 
major traditional and alternative assets. These statistics convey 
some of the important relationships in alternative investments. 

• Private equity is expected to have a higher return than 

public equities. The differential here is over 4% and volatility 
reflects appraised value volatility, not economic risk of 
illiquidity and leverage. This 4% premium is supported by 
comparing median IRRs with 6-year rolling performance of 
equity markets.

• Unlevered property has a return and risk between stocks 

and bonds.

• Not shown, but as this sector leverages up (e.g., in 

opportunistic funds), the returns and risks approach 
equities.

• A diversified portfolio of hedge funds has bond-like 

volatility and bond-like return and a beta around 0.3 to the 
equity market.

• Commodities have equity-like volatility, returns around cash 

and a low, but positive correlation with equities.

However, we need to be careful how we interpret these 
performance numbers. Estimating alternatives performance 
is complicated by what is called 'stale pricing,' the slow 
adjustment of appraised valuations embedded in the net asset 
value (NAV). The result is that the volatility based on NAVs – 
especially those that do not trade – is lower than what the 
market (or economic) volatility would be based on market 
transactions. There are also issues about survivor-bias and 
selection-bias in the indices because fund managers are not 
required to disclose their returns publicly.

To get a sense of how large this impact could be, we provide 
two estimates of volatility and serial correlation for alternatives 
over the last 26 years: one based on quarterly data and one 
based on rolling annual estimates.

Note that the serial correlations based on quarterly data are 
quite high, especially for property. We believe this is a sign 
of stale pricing. Cash has a different serial correlation issue 
as central banks have large control over these yields and 
subsequent returns. When we simply look at annual data, 
serial correlation declines.

Once we move to annual estimates, we have notable increases 
in the volatility of private equity (from 10.1% to 14.8%), 
unlevered property (4.1% to 7.5%) and hedge funds (7.0% to 
8.3%). We believe annual estimates provide clearer insight, 
but still don't reflect all the risks associated with alternatives.

Additional items to consider are the equity correlation and 
equity beta. When adjusted to the annual level, we see private 
equity having an equity correlation rising from 0.77 to 0.80 
and equity betas rise from 0.48 to 0.68.

Real estate exhibits a similar pattern in relationship to equities, 
though more muted. The quarterly data shows a lower 
correlation than the annual data (0.20 compared to 0.28) and 
equity beta increases from 0.05 to 0.13.

These historic performance numbers give a good showing 
of the relationship for returns, but not for risks. In particular, 
because of the stale pricing problems, we believe that the 
volatility of real estate and private equity underestimate the 
true risks of these investments. We estimate an 'economic' 
risk as opposed to NAV volatility. Hedge fund volatility 
is a different issue, as the market is far more liquid and 
competitive than the high growth era of the late 1990s and 
early 2000s.

1.4.  The liquidity risk premium and appraised versus 

economic risk

Compensation for illiquidity is one of the rationales for 
higher expected returns in alternative investments. From the 
demand side, by giving up the option to sell at the investor's 
convenience, the investor is meant to be rewarded with higher 
cash flows. 

However, demand for a premium must be supplied by some 
economic mechanism and it is these economic risks that 
we should be measuring and managing, not the appraised 
ones. There are many mechanisms through which alternative 
managers can create these transformations, especially when 
aided by explicit rules limiting when pay-outs can occur 
(thus, eliminating market pricing as well as panic selling by 
investors). The most obvious way to model this transformation 

mechanism is simple leverage in the equity or fixed income 
markets without the constraint of margin management. Other 
methods are to take on maturity mismatches or substitute 
with higher levels of credit risk. A final mechanism may be 
used of various option writing strategies that can produce 
high Sharpe ratios in the short and intermediate run, but have 
tremendous downside risk when tail-events happen.

We believe that the economic measure of risk is most 
important for investors. This economic risk will include 
underlying exposures (leverage, credit) as well as the indirect 
costs of illiquidity. 

We also provide estimates of appraised volatility, as investors 
will be interested in how volatile the reported funds and total 
portfolio will be1.

1  In fact, a few academics are skeptical of any real advantage of private assets and allege that the true appeal is the lower reported volatility. 

See Ilmanen et. al. 2020.

2. Real estate

Even though it has features of both equity and fixed income, 
private real estate1 behaves differently than these asset 
classes. It starts with the contractual nature of real estate, 
which is always a tangible asset (physical ownership of land 
or buildings), while corporate ownership can consist of non-
tangible capital such as patents and software. This limits the 
potential scalability of real estate compared to equities. 

The historical experience of real estate in the US is quite good. 
As Exhibit 6 shows, unlevered institutional real estate has had 
equity like-returns over the long run. Volatility – admittedly 
distorted by the appraisal process, but getting better – is quite 
low. We don’t expect such stellar performance going forward, 
but even with lower returns and higher volatility, real estate 
clearly deserves strong consideration in portfolios.

One empirical advantage of real estate is its historically low 
correlation with equities – around 0.2 to 0.3 – and it has at 
times had its own distinct cycle. We can easily find periods 
where equities behave quite differently, namely the real 
estate bust of the 1980s and the tech bust of the early 2000s. 
On the other hand, both real estate and equities had large 
declines around the Global Financial Crisis (GFC).

An additional feature of the private real estate market and its 
vehicle structure is that it allows the use of leverage to improve 
the return profile. This leverage would be difficult for individual 
investors, but can be effectively implemented and managed by 
professionals. As we move up in leverage, we see smaller fund 
sizes and greater concentration in speculative ventures. 

At the most basic level, all existing commercial property 
could be available for purchase, but in practice, only part of 
the market is actually investable by institutional investors. 
When estimating the size of the real estate market, we 
look at the market at two levels. The broadest measure is 
basic property market as measured by the MSCI IPS data. In 
practice, however, most institutional investors access the real 
estate market through actively managed funds2. In turn, these 
actively managed funds can be divided into two classes: open-
ended (or evergreen) funds and close-ended funds, which 
have a planned time horizon in which to return all assets to 
investors.

In practice, real estate is highly dependent on location and 
property type and diversified portfolios focus on balancing 
these bets. Typical property types are office, apartments, 
retail, and industrial. Another distinct feature of real estate is 
the different measures of valuation than equity. Real estate 
focuses on capitalization rates, which is more similar to a yield 
(or inverted P/E ratio) and price per square foot, for example. 

Real estate's illiquid nature makes all buying and selling 
a negotiated process. It reinforces the long-term view of 
investing. Investors in the most liquid vehicles (core funds) 
should expect that it may take several quarters to sell 
properties and redeem the fund's holdings. Value-added 
and opportunistic investors will have to go to the secondary 
market to sell their shares.

1  We clarify that we are talking about private real estate as opposed to 

public real estate expressed in the REIT market. REITs behave more like 
a small cap value stock: they have equity-like volatility (around 17% to 
19%) and are part of many equity indices. Separating out REITs as an 
asset class raises a problem of potential double counting.

2  Some investors do invest directly without funds. We don't have good 

measures of the extent and size of this market.

2.1. Real estate performance
When we look at performance of the real estate market 
we need to differentiate between the open-end and the 
closed-end markets. The best estimate of the basic real estate 
market in the US is the National Property Index (NPI), which 
represents unlevered property as reported by institutional 
investors. The performance of this unlevered property index is 
quite good on a NAV basis (i.e. appraised value). The returns 
since 1994 have been 9.2% with a standard deviation of 
7.5%, as measured through annualized returns.

When we move into the performance of open ended funds, 
the Open Diversified Core Equity (ODCE) from NCREIF is most 
common benchmark and performs in line with the NPI. In the 
last few years the ODCE index has had a higher return than 
the NPI. We note that in down markets for real estate, the 
ODCE index has underperformed. 

For the performance of the closed-end sector, we look at 
the IRRs of three groups: 1) Core and Core Plus Funds, 2) 
Value-Added Funds, and 3) Opportunistic Funds. With one 
exception, the performance is in line with what we expect: 
riskier funds have higher IRRs. However, at the highest level of 
risk, the Opportunistic funds performs slightly below Value-
Added funds. 

Other observations about real estate performance:
– ODCE: The effect of leverage is noticeable on the downside 

and upside for the ODCE set of funds. In the latest bull 
market (2010-2015), these funds provided a return 1.3% 
above the unlevered benchmark net-of-fees. In the brief 
down market (2004-2007), they underperformed by -3.9%. 

– This is consistent with the negative skewness between the 

indices. Note that the ODCE has a larger negative skewness 
coefficient than the NPI. 

– For closed-end funds, Core and Value-Added funds have 

performed as expected, with both sectors doing quite well 
at times. Opportunistic funds have struggled to keep up 
with Value-added funds, but have beaten ODCE and Core 
funds. The real outlier may be Value-Added funds with 
strong performance in each time period.

– The funds subsequent performance follows the market 

performance by a one-year to 18-month lag. This makes sense 
as closed-end funds are locked into the subsequent few years 
of performance as capital gets called and redistributed.

The historic data suggest:
– Core managers should earn a premium over unlevered 

real estate.

– Value-Added and Opportunistic funds earn a further 

premium, but is has been inconsistent.

In a sense, private real estate trades off positive skewness for 
steadier income and moderate capital appreciation that should 
be more correlated with inflation.1 This is supported by statistics 
in the performance in Exhibit 6 real estate has the most negative 

skewness of any of the asset classes as well as the highest 
kurtosis for both the quarterly and annual estimates. The 
inflation correlation is slightly better than other asset classes. 

In summary, we see that real estate offers a different return 
profile than equities and bonds. Without leverage, they 
offer steady income with modest price appreciation; thus, 
capping upside moves, and leaving some significant downside 
risk. More aggressive strategies offer returns that approach 
equities, but with commensurate risk.

1  However, the negative skewness could be a relic of the appraisal process. The data is very limited, but indices based purely on transactions don't show 

the negative skewness (and of course have much higher volatility). It could be that in the appraisal process, gains are gradually written up over years, 
while losses are written down over a matter of quarters.

3. Private equity

Given the track record shown in Exhibit 6, it is no surprise 
that interest in private equity has boomed. Most private 
equity investors are satisfied with their portfolios and we 
expect slight increases in allocation by investors in the coming 
decade.

Private equity encompasses a large number of strategies and 
niche markets. It can broadly be broken into three groups: 
return-oriented strategies, debt strategies, and natural 
resource strategies. Within return-oriented strategies, we 
have the traditional buyout and venture cap funds with a new 
category of growth funds. Within debt, we have distressed 
debt, mezzanine and direct lending (private credit). Natural 
resource funds include energy specific projects, timberland 
and farmland and aim to provide better inflation protection.

Buyout funds aim to buy poorly run public companies, take 
them private, restructure them and then spin them off for 
large profits. Historically, they have a controversial reputation 
since the public targets often have entrenched management 
or other stake-holders that resist change. Under private 
ownership, management is relieved of public disclosure 
requirements and can focus on restructuring the firm (both 
on a capital and strategic plan basis). For leveraged buyouts, 
the use of debt within their holdings further enhances the 
potential return. More recently, the criticism has turned to 
the excessive use of debt that leaves these firms vulnerable to 
downturns.

Venture capital investing looks to invest in completely new 
firms and ideas with markets. The failure rate can be quite 
high (well over 50%), but all it takes are a few 'home-runs' to 
produce extraordinary returns.

Many funds now focus on growth strategies. These strategies 
provide additional financing, management and governance 
assistance to propel an existing business onto the next stage. 
Unlike buyout funds which sometimes has a confrontational 
strategy with existing management of target companies, 
growth strategies work with existing management. Growth 
funds look for companies that are small and proven to be led 
by talented entrepreneurs. They provide them with capital 
and expertise to expand rapidly and secure larger market 
share. Buyout funds typical involve significant management 
changes and reorientation of business strategy. This growth 
category is a mix of late-stage venture and limited buyout of 
management. 

Sometimes the credit vehicles of the private markets are 
combined with the buy-out, growth and venture capital funds 
in the definition of private equity. These credit niches of the 
private equity market are:

– Distressed investing. Distressed investing focuses on 

purchasing debt of companies in or near default and 
negotiating new structures. Given the low quality of the 
debt held by these funds, we expect near equity return 
from them, offset by high costs and delayed payoffs from 
litigation and negotiation in the bankruptcy process 

– Mezzanine financing. Mezzanine financing is junior debt 

financing and should command a premium to compensate 
for its lower status on the capital stack. They can include 
warrants which add an equity-like upside option to the 
returns. Thus, it is a sort of convertible bond, but applied to 
private sector companies and outside some Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC) registration.

– Direct lending/private credit. Although it has always existed, 

this sector boomed after the GFC as banks had to retreat in 
lending that serviced smaller companies and family business 
that urgently needed capital and were willing to pay higher 
interest rates. It has now become a standard part of the 
alternatives universe with explicit allocation targets at the 
sub-asset class level by some large institutional investors.

Finally, another subsector of the broad private asset class is 
natural resources: Investments dedicated to specific segments 
of energy, timber and farmland. Many investors have carved 
out a 'Real Asset' or 'Inflation-protection' category in their 
SAA and this type of natural resource fund can be a major 
component.1

3.1. Cash flows and the J-curve
One of the unique features of private equity investing and 
closed-end funds is the cash flow nature of the investment. 
This has important implications in building and maintaining 
allocations to private capital.

When general partners launch a fund, they target a size and 
market niche and begin fund raising. The fund-raising cycle is 
finding investors (limited partners) to make current and future 
cash flows. These limited partners make a commitment to the 
fund and sign agreements about investing money into the 
fund. Over time, these commitments are called (capital calls) 

1 This real asset category would also include real estate, inflation-indexed bonds and commodities. 
15

as needed by the general partners and typically are done over 
a three-year cycle, though in many cases the remaining calls 
can take many years to be finished.

For example a USD100 million fund with a 10-year life span. 
Initially, limited partners put in 10.5% or USD10.5 million 
into the fund. Over subsequent years the remaining USD89.5 
million is put in with the vast majority done by the fourth year. 
Payouts don't occur until year 2 (USD4 million), but increase 
rapidly with the success of the fund and peak in year 6 at 
USD33 million. 

If we look at a graph of cash flows and net cash flows, we can 
see the J-curve, which refers to the net cash flows in the first 
five years. This is one of the features of private asset investing: 
negative cash flows in the initial years with little to no positive 
returns and a rapid reversal into positive cash flows if successful. 
It means that funds cannot be evaluated in the first few years. 
We use six years as the standard for evaluating private equity 
(which is about how long it takes to build a mature portfolio).

These net cash flows determine the internal rate of return 
(IRR). In this case, the cash flows provide an 11.6% internal 
rate of return. The total distributions are USD146 million, 
which based on USD100 million of contributions, produces a 
Distribution-to-Paid-In (DPI) ratio of 1.46.

Typically, the contributions are done within three to four years, 
though in some cases the final few percent of calls can take 
much longer and are netted against distributions. The typical 
'cash-weighted time of contributions' is about 2.5 years. Most 

funds extend their life beyond 10-years. (The ideal case is a 
10-year payout partnership with a one-year wind down of final 
assets.) A few funds have lasted 20 years or more.

Performance is greatly affected by the year the fund started 
– the vintage year. This shouldn't be surprising as the 
performance of public equities is also dependent on the time 
period selected. One of the efforts in private investing is to 
manage vintage year diversification. Unlike public markets, 
where one can invest in an open-ended or evergreen vehicle, 
private assets require constant recycling of assets and impose 
high research and oversight costs.

At the fund level, there are several measures of fund 
performance. The most cited number is the 
Internal-rate-of-return (IRR). The IRR is cash flow weighted 
return and is calculated differently than the standard time-
weighted rate of return used for public assets. There can be a 
large discrepancy of gross IRR and net IRR due to fees.

Other measures that investors focus on are distributions to 
paid-in (DPI). This is simply the ratio of cumulative distributions 
to cumulative capital committed (which does not consider 
compounding of interest). A similar metric is the Net Multiple, 
which adjusts for fees. Finally, there is the private market 
equivalent (PME). The PME simply compares the performance 
of the cash flows if they had been invested in the public 
market instead of the particular partnership of portfolio of 
partnerships. The result is a ratio of added (or detracted) value 
compared to the market.

3.2. Performance
Historic performance bears out the higher return for private 
equity over public equities. As this simple comparison of IRRs 
by vintage years and subsequent six-year performance of the 
S&P 500 shows, the median private equity fund outperformed 
the public equity market by 5.5% per year. The strongest 
period was the late 1990s during the tech boom with an 
8.2% outperformance, but the mid-2000s also had strong 
performance relative to the S&P 500. 

However, after 2007 the performance has been lower and the 
vintage 2008 year particularly struggled. When we take the 
average premium of the last 10 years of data with six years 
of history, we get an average premium of 2.1% – near the 
2.0% premium that is the rule-of-thumb when thinking about 
private equity.

Another feature of private equity is a huge disparity of 
performance, much larger than seen in traditional public 
equity portfolios. Exhibit 13 shows the wide range between 
the 75th and 25th percentile IRRs by vintage year, a spread 
which averaged 17.5%.  

Like the equity market, timing is important. Early 1990s funds 
that jumped into internet and tech stocks have the highest 
returns. However, 1999 and 2000 vintages did poorly as 
they invested into a declining and consolidating market. The 

illiquid nature of private equity makes timing the market 
near impossible, as capital calls can force investors to invest 
in funds with shaky prospects once commitments are made 
unless they want to risk their opportunity to invest in the 
future. 

Although we see private equity doing better than the public 
markets, we don't have any good comparable risk measures 
between the two asset classes, so risk-adjusted performance 
is very hard to assess.

3.3. Private credit
There have always been credit aspects to the private equity 
space: mezzanine financing and distressed debt, but a 
different niche has emerged in the last 12 years: direct 
lending. According to the Preqin database, direct lending 
funds in 2006 totaled around USD1.0 billion and rose to 
USD59.8 billion by 2017. 

When banking regulation after the GFC tightened up capital 
requirements, this left a market gap and non-bank pools 
have capital have stepped in. These tend to focus more 

on niche markets such as smaller, family-owned or single 
entrepreneur enterprises that have become stretched due 
to tax issues, mismatches of assets and liabilities, and other 
unique circumstances. The other hallmark of these funds is 
immediacy. These borrowers typically have enough assets, but 
need a large amount of cash to refinance, make tax payments, 
and settle family splits or similar large cash outflows. Because 
of the immediacy needs and potential risks, private credit 
funds can charge very high interest rates and generate equity-
like returns at times.

We find that the performance of private debt funds is similar 
to high yield. When we chart the vintage year IRRs of private 
debt funds we see that they track the beginning of the year 
yield-to-worst of the high yield market (with no default rates 
added, which normally depress returns by 200 basis points 
or so). With default rates added, we expect the actual return 
of high yield to be lower, so private debt does have a higher 
return than high yield due to better collateral.

As can be seen in Exhibit 14, the premium of median private 
debt IRRs compared to the yield-to-worst has averaged 0.7% 
over this time period. Although steady in the last few years, we 
note that the periods of substantial underperformance coincide 
with years of turmoil for the high-yield market (2008, 2003).

3.4. Natural resources, energy and timber/farmland
Several major investors have carved out specific allocations 
to natural resource-related projects: oil & gas development, 
renewable alternatives, pipelines, timber and farmland. This 
carve-out is often a significant part of a 'Real Asset' category, 
which is expected to do well in inflationary or commodity-
driven markets. After fundraising and investment peaked in 
2014 amid high oil prices, investment in this sector has declined 
and the orientation is shifting. Energy and natural resource 
plays like some other types of alternatives involve physical 
assets, but unlike real estate, they seem to undergo larger and 
more frequent cycles. 

When we look at the performance of natural resource funds in 
the Preqin database, we see outstanding performance in 2002 
and 2003 vintages – no surprise as energy prices boomed and 
peaked in mid-2008. However, since then the median IRRs have 
been well below the aggregate group of private equity funds, 
reflecting the downtrend in oil prices since their peak.

Despite the performance gap, there is still considerable interest 
in natural resource investing and recent fundraising has partially 
recovered from its 2015 lows. We expect the natural resource 
sector to continue to be a small component of the overall 
alternative portfolios. 

For convenience, we include timber and farmland investments 
in this category, although they can clearly cross over into real 
estate just as well. There was an investment boom in timber 
the mid-2000s and several major institutional investors invested 
significantly in this area. Unfortunately, it has performed poorly 
and caused headaches for several prominent investors (see 
Harvard articles). We expect a handful of dedicated efforts, but 
nowhere near the interest seen in the 2000s.

As of December 2019, the NCREIF Timberland National 
Property Index was based on USD23.2 billion of assets and the 
NCREIF Farmland NPI was based on USD11.4 billion of assets. 
Here are some summary statistics as it compares to real estate 
and equities.

First, the returns from timber are disappointing (the 10-year 
return through June 2020 is just 4.4%). Second, as seen in 
other analysis, the standard deviations from annual estimates 
are higher than the quarterly estimates showing smoother 
returns. Third, despite the limited quality of the data, the equity 
correlation and beta coefficients indicate that these asset 
classes may have some diversification potential. However, the 
size of the market questions the ability to scale these sub-asset 
classes. We expect them to remain niche sectors and only a 
very small part of total portfolios.

Finally, we find conflicting signals about relationship of 
timberland and farmland to inflation. Using quarterly data, 
we find a consistent negative correlation. However, when we 
look at annual data, we find a modest positive correlation 
(though reversed in the last 10 years). In contrast, real estate 
as measured by the NCREIF Property Index shows a relatively 
consistent positive correlation with inflation in both annual 
and quarterly terms. For timberland and farmland, we are 
inclined to believe the annual results that show a slight positive 
correlation. We assume that the lagged appraisal process 
distorts some of the relationships that only show up in longer 
term estimates.

4. Infrastructure

Infrastructure funds invest in large capital projects and often 
have a 'public-private' perspective. Like private equity, these 
projects have long time horizons, typically longer. But they 
have aspects of real estate as well since they involve physical 
(tangible) capital and should be more resilient in inflationary 
environments.

Infrastructure, like private equity, is a cash flow investment 
strategy, but there are substantive differences in the type of 
investment, payout period, and expected performance that 
is distinguished from 'traditional' private equity. Moreover, 
infrastructure is fundamentally different in they are always 
physical, capital intensive projects, not software or services. 
They have large up-front capital costs, longer but steadier 
payout periods, and an element of government involvement 
because of the public nature of the investment. In a sense, 
they are a 'low beta' private equity investment.

Consequently, infrastructure has a different profile than 
private equities and real estate. 

Types of projects that infrastructure funds invest in are:

– Port construction, maintenance, and expansion
– Airports 
– Energy related: grids, power construction
– Tollways

Infrastructure first appeared in the early 2000s and has 
become a standard part of private asset portfolios. In 
addition, like real estate, the category has refined into sub-
strategies of core, value-added and opportunistic investing 
depending on the amount of leverage, riskiness of the 
projects and concentration risk.

4.1. Cash flow characteristics of infrastructure funds
The three distinguishing characteristics of infrastructure funds 
compared to standard private equity funds are the longer 
duration, greater stability of cash flows, and lower expected 
IRRs. Infrastructure funds have a longer expected time 
horizon: 12 to 15 years versus 10 for private equity. 

Here is a typical cash flow profile of an infrastructure fund.

For this fund, we have an IRR of 8.1%. Although the 
contribution period is similar to the private equity about (2.4 
year average contribution period), the time weighted cash 
flow payout is much larger (8.0 years versus 5.9 years).

4.2. Performance
We don't have a long history of infrastructure performance, 
as the asset class started in the late 1990s and early 2000s 
and the data is sparse for these early years. Contrary to 
other private asset classes, there is no generally accepted 
performance index for infrastructure (either equity or debt). By 
the late 2000s, we get enough funds for reasonable analysis. 
As seen in Exhibit 18, the median IRRs for infrastructure are 
always below those of PE by an average of 3.8% and the 
subsequent 6-year return of the S&P 500 (3.7% for the 2008-
2013 time period). Despite the horrendous start in 2008 and 
2009, the S&P 500 performs exceptionally well in this time 
period. A more appropriate comparison might be with global 
equities.

Infrastructure offers a diversified set of cash flows for long 
term investors and behaves differently than private equity. 
We expect this asset class to continue to grow in size and 
become more heterogeneous in offerings. Because of the 
public/private nature of the investment, we expect returns to 
be steadier with some downside protection for low leveraged 
projects and similar caps on upside gains.

5. Hedge Funds

Strictly speaking hedge funds are not an asset class, but 
a set of active strategies. They are applied in two ways: 
1) strategically, as an asset class, and 2) as a source of 
independent alpha that is embedded into other asset classes. 
Either way, they can play a large enough role in portfolio 
construction that they merit considerable attention. Most 
aggregate statistics clearly indicate that the performance of 
hedge funds is different from stocks and bonds. 

Hedge funds encompass a wide variety of strategies. They can 
be very concentrated with some funds holding a handful of 
leveraged bets or they can involve high-trading strategies that 
try to squeeze small margins in thousands of transactions a day. 

Since we are focusing on strategic asset allocation, we look 
at what portfolios of hedge funds produce, not individual 
performance or performance of sub-sectors. This starts with 
looking at the track record of broad indices and fund-of-fund 
indices and extrapolating to what investors should expect. 
Building a well-constructed portfolio amid the thousands of 
hedge funds requires a lot of specific knowledge about the 
opportunities and how the cycle over time. 

5.1. Hedge fund performance
The data show two distinct periods for hedge funds. The 
growth phase was from the mid-1990s through the GFC. 
Returns were excellent with outstanding Sharpe ratios 
for whole groups of funds. The growth rates of assets in 
management between 2000 and 2007 was 21%, but slipped 
to 10% per year in the 2008 to 2017 level, peaking at around 
USD3.2 trillion, a level that the industry has hovered around 
since.

Hedge fund performance over the last 25 years has two 
distinct periods. The growth period from the early 1990s to 
the GFC was very strong, as performance in some categories 
exceeded equities, but with much lower volatility, producing 
outstanding Sharpe ratios. However, after the GFC the 
character of performance changed with much lower returns 
and a decline in the Sharpe ratios. 

In Exhibit 19, we present the performance of hedge funds 
and focus on performance of broad indices and fund-of-fund 
performance. Along with long term performance, we look at 
the latest 10 years and well as performance prior to the GFC. 
We still have to be careful about interpreting the performance 
of hedge funds. While we consider the returns accurate over 
the long time horizon, there are concerns about stale-pricing 
distorting the NAVs and hence, the reported volatility over 
time (though we do note that the serial correlations at the 
quarterly level don't support these concerns). Additionally, 
there are always issues about survivor bias and reporting bias 
for fund based indices.1 In the Appendix, we provide data 
about the performance of specific sub-sectors of the hedge 
fund market as categorized by different index providers.

1 See Getmansky, Lo and Makarov (2004) for a fuller discussion of serial correlation, survivor bias and reporting bias in these estimates

Observations:
– Long run Sharpe ratios for hedge funds are in line with equities 

and treasuries. Performance prior to the GFC was very strong 
with ratios across the board better than equities and bonds. 
In the last ten years, the ratios have been lower, especially 
compared to stocks and bonds. Stocks and bonds had a stellar 
decade in the 2010s, so the hurdle was quite high.

– Returns have declined over time. High single digit returns 

prior to the GFC or better are the norm prior to the GFC, but 
low single digit returns in the last ten years. In excess returns 
(i.e. returns over cash), the differences are much smaller. 

– Volatility has declined over time. 

– Correlation to equities and beta are higher post-GFC.

When we look at hedge funds as an asset class, we believe 
that well-diversified portfolios can achieve volatilities around 
4% to 6% with equity betas around 0.25 to 0.3. The returns 
will likely remain low which given the low yield environment 
means net returns around 3.5% to 4.5%. Higher return 
targets will require more concentrated portfolios and higher 
risks. We would expect such strategies to have a higher 
correlation with equities.

We need to also acknowledge that hedge funds can also 
be alpha diversifiers and can be combined with other asset 
classes that exhibit low information ratios. Such approaches 
lead to revision of alpha and tracking error estimates for these 
portfolios. Skillful selection of such funds should improve 
overall portfolio performance.

6. Commodities

Dedicated commodity exposures for institutional investors 
started in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The performance 
of oil in the 1970s and early 1990s suggested both strong 
inflation protection and a negative correlation with equities 
and fixed income; thus, they could be very valuable in real 
terms with outstanding diversification benefits. Additionally, 
these high returns from back-tests made the asset class look 
promising from a return perspective as well. With concerns 
about 'running out of resources' future returns had a large 
scarcity premium. 

Unfortunately, in practice, commodity prices declined in 
the 1990s and inflation ticked downward, disappointing 
commodity investors. Rising oil and food prices in the mid-
2000s revived interest, as did another mini-boom in the 
early part of the 2010s. However, in hindsight, these look 
like classic bubbles and the subsequent busts quickly wiped 
out years of gains. We note that oil prices (oil is the largest 
component of several indices) today are still over 50% below 
their peaks reached in the summer of 2008. Of course, the 
drop looks worse in real terms.

Consequently, the performance of the long-only commodity 
indices based on rolling-futures contracts has been more than 
disappointing. Returns are negative in real terms. Volatility 
is about what has been expected (near equities), and have 
a positive correlation with equities. This last fact greatly 
weakens the case for a strategic allocation to commodities. In 
the active space with commodity trading advisors (CTAs), the 
returns have been underwhelming as well.

Various efforts at rationalizing a premium for long-only 
commodities investors have been put forward: imbalances 
between hedging by suppliers and users of commodities, 
insurance premiums inherent in the market, ever growing 
scarcity in commodities, etc. The skeptical view of 
commodities has questioned any premium (spot commodity 
prices have been decreasing in real terms for hundreds of 
years). Moreover, to access this asset class, investors must 
manage a portfolio of futures or swap contracts and their roll 
over time. Investing through such contracts means that there 
are three components to returns:

– Collateral return: The return on Treasury bills for the period. 

Index performance assumes 100% collateralization.1

 
– Price return: The return from the spot price at maturity 

versus the contracted forward price at the commencement 
of the contract.

– Roll return: The return from converting from a maturing 

contract and rolling into a new contract. Erb and Campbell 
(2015) categorize this as part of the 'income' return for 
commodities. Rownenhoorst and Gorton propose that the 
return from roll yields declined after the 1990s.

Thus, actual returns can at times be quite different from 
movements in spot prices and are sensitive to supply and 
demand for hedging and speculation. At the end of a 
contract, futures prices must be reconciled against spot prices, 
and therefore physical demand and supply of commodities 
matter. While short term firms have rather inelastic demand 
because, for example, if they have a natural gas-powered 
plant, they will not need any other fuel but natural gas. Over 
the longer run, as the plant becomes obsolete, it will be 
replaced by whatever energy source is relatively cheaper. So 
in the medium and long term, competitive pressures will push 
energy and other commodity prices down.

1  In practice, managers invest only 10% or so in collateral and invest the remainder in higher yielding instruments. Thus, they are overlaying the 

exposure with some duration and credit risk.

We model commodities starting with cash returns because 
the pricing of financial futures contracts involves Treasury bill 
yields. The relationship between spot and future prices are not 
stable and are based on storage costs and perishability factors 
interacting with interest rates and supply and demand factors.

As Exhibit 20 shows, commodity prices peaked in mid-2008 
and crashed precipitously into 2009. Investors in the two most 
prominent indices (the Bloomberg Commodity Index and 
the S&P Commodity Index) have not recovered to their 2008 
peaks. Gold, however, kept rising in the post GFC era and hit 
a peak in 2010 before plummeting in 2012. Gold has had a 
recent rally, piquing some renewed interest in the asset class.  

Investors approach the commodities market in two ways: 
through passive funds that match an established index 
or through active trading with CTAs (Commodity Trading 
Advisors). We estimate the investment in commodities 
by institutional investors is very small relative to the 
overall market. ETFs and mutual funds in the US are only 
USD10 billion, collective investment trusts as measured 
by Morningstar are about USD6.4 billion, and the Preqin 
database has another USD61 billion in CTA funds. Outside the 
US this is a more attractive asset class, so add in dedicated 
allocations by non-US investors and this is probably no more 
than USD250 billion. When compared to the USD110 trillion 
that UBS measures for total investable assets, this is probably 
between 0.2% and 0.3% of the market.

6.1. Gold
Gold is one of the assets with the longest history and has 
played an enormous role in finance. However, with the 
constraints of gold-based currencies, national governments 
have moved to fiat currencies and don't promise any support 
in terms of gold.

Gold clearly behaves differently from other commodities. As 
the chart above shows, gold tracked the broad commodities 
index into the global financial crisis, but diverted thereafter, 
continuing upward and doubling in value afterwards while 
commodities dropped.

Some argue that gold is not a commodity, but a currency. 
Some central banks do maintain positions in gold. The US 
dollar was unpegged to gold in 1972. We think that central 
bank purchases which are not always publicly announced have 
a material effect on gold price dynamics.

We do see a better case for gold over commodities in the 
historic data: higher returns, lower volatility, and a near-zero 
correlation with equities.

6.2. Commodities and gold as inflation hedges
One rationale for holding commodities and gold is that 
they provide protection against inflation. The historic data 
do indicate that commodities as reflected in the two major 
indices are correlated with inflation as measured by the US 
Consumer Price Index. 

However, this is only a partial hedge. As services become a 
larger part of the economy and manufacturing declines, we 
would expect commodities to have a lower impact in overall 
CPI. The correlation of commodities to inflation is rather 
modest, ranging from around 0.1 to 0.4 depending on how it 
is measured.

Gold has demonstrated a mixed reaction to inflation. It 
performs well both in increases of unexpected inflation and 
large moves downward in inflation. 

In sum, we agree that gold has its own cycle and idiosyncratic 
elements to it. Should inflation break out above the current 
level of expectations (2.0%) for developed economies, we 
would expect gold to do well and offer some of the best 
returns available in a rising inflation environment.

6.3. Summary
The recent performance of commodities has seriously dented 
passive commodities' attractiveness as a strategic asset class 
for institutional investors. Low inflation, the negative real 
return and positive correlation with equities has been strong 
headwinds for commodities. 

The most compelling case for commodities is that global 
growth kicks back to a higher gear and the supply chains 
lag behind demand. Many of these commodities – like 
natural resources and infrastructure – require a large capital 
commitment and several years before extraction is done. A 
rising cost-pressure inflation world could cause equities and 
bonds slump in relative terms.

Also, there is a case for commodities for some investors 
from a holistic perspective. Countries that are resource-light 
such Korea or Taiwan or companies that are sensitive to 
commodities like transportation or steel may want to hold 
some commodity exposure to reduce overall risk. An airline or 
cruise line, for example, may want to add commodities in their 
portfolio to hedge oil risk for the overall organization.

7. Integration with traditional asset classes

Ultimately, investors need to blend traditional and alternative 
asset classes into a strategic asset allocation. The standard 
tool for SAA work – mean-variance analysis – works well 
with traditional assets, but runs into difficulties when applied 
to cash flow oriented investments. For cash flow assets, we 
must work with appraised assets with NAVs that don't reflect 
any sort of market transactions. Thus, NAV based volatility 
measures appear smoothed and underestimate actual 
volatility. 

Further compounding the issue, these cash flow asset classes 
cannot be managed through market transactions, but through 
commitment schedules that require the investor provide 
the liquidity to the general partner. This means a lagged 
adjustment to changing market events (which in turn is why 
fundraising is so cyclical).

Our approach is to develop two measures: appraised volatility 
and economic risk. The economic risk reflects the underlying, 
unsmoothed risk inherent in these investments. Investors 
should be aware of both measures.

7.1. Formulating return and risk expectations
Since alternatives cover a wide array of investment opportunities 
with different economic rationales, we need to use a wide array 
of approaches to formulate prospective returns.

To model real estate, we start with expected unlevered 
property returns and then adjust for leverage. Basic property 
has an income component and a price return component. 
Historically, in the US the income component for the NPI 
has been around 4% to 5%. With inflation around 2.0% 
and a small real appreciation (after maintenance and capital 
improvements) of 0.3%, we currently estimate that unlevered 
property has a net return of 5.5%. When we adjust for fees, 
alpha and leverage, we get returns that begin approach long 
run equity returns: in the 6.2% range.

Our approach to setting private equity assumptions uses a 
multi-factor capital-asset pricing model type of approach 
and assigns higher betas to the relative public equities 
and additional idiosyncratic risk.1 When we include some 
mezzanine financing and special situations, we estimate that 
a private equity portfolio would have economic risks around 
24% compared to our volatility of 15.0% to 16.0% for global 
equity portfolios.

As discussed in Section 3.3, our analysis finds that 
private debt funds appear to track the high yield market. 
Consequently, we model private debt related to the high yield 
market with a spread of about 80 basis points relative to the 
prevailing yield-to-worst.

Note:  Expected returns are geometrc. We develop 5-year expected returns in the capital markets based on current market markets and our expectations 
of inflation, growth and the path of interest rates. We then overlay our assessment of fair value and the reversion and how quickly the market will 
react.  From here we extrapolate to the different sectors of the capital markets. Global Equity, Private Equity, Infrastructure, and Core Real Estate 
are assumed to be unhedged. Cash, fixed income and hedge funds are assumed to be hedged.

1  See Korteweg (2018) for a good summary of the academic literature. Researchers find that buy-out funds have betas relative to public markets ranging 

from 1.0 to as high as 3.0. Venture capital funds have lower betas, but much higher idiosyncratic risk.

Like real estate, we view infrastructure as a hybrid of equity 
and fixed income. The median IRR for infrastructure funds 
by vintage year has been consistently below that of private 
equity by an average of 3.9%. Consequently, one simple 
approach is simply to discount the return to private equity by 
an appropriate amount and set economic risk appropriate for 
such risk-bearing. This gives us net returns around 6.2% – 
similar to real estate, but with a different risk profile. 

We rely on a combination of historic relationships and basic 
heuristics to model hedge funds. As noted in the review of 
historic performance, fund-of-fund composites of hedge 
funds returns in the last 10-years have been about 2.5% to 
3.8% above cash with equity betas around 0.30. 

We believe that the prospect for hedge funds is encouraging. 
With low interest rates and low credit spreads across the 
world, the costs of borrowing are extremely low. This 
leverages the alpha opportunity set for all sorts of hedge 
funds – long-short, market neutral and macros funds – 
and previously unprofitable trades now look attractive. 
Additionally, the steeper yield curve offers all sorts of 
opportunities in fixed income such as carry trades and roll 
return. This low borrowing cost environment should last for a 
few years, as central banks have indicated high thresholds for 
any rise in short term rates.  

Another boost for hedge funds may be greater dispersion of 
returns, which will benefit strategies like equity long/short and 
relative. Additional tailwinds are fits of volatility and regime 
changes. These will allow trading-oriented macro managers 
to exploit uncorrelated trades opportunities.  It is synchronous 
moves in markets and within markets that don’t allow hedge 
fund managers to apply their winners versus losers investment 
approach.

Finally, after moving sideways for a few years and a decline in 
the number of hedge funds, the industry is starting to regain 
momentum. We see positive cash flows as investors rebalance 
from the high equity returns and low government bond yields. 
Alternative investments that offer steady income or steady 
NAVs increases will be very attractive.  

Commodities are a hard asset class to model. We have no 
demand-side or supply-side model to lean on as a starting 
point. Our only piece of financial theory is that since these are 
futures contracts, the contracts will price in the opportunity 
cost of fully collateralized positions; thus, we expect a cash 
return plus a highly idiosyncratic element.

Investors are ultimately interested in net-of-fee performance 
and we need to assess both the fees and expected alpha 
from alternative investments. Because of the research costs 
and expertise needed to implement alternative portfolios, 
the management fees are extremely high compared to what 
is seen in public assets classes. The 2 and 20 model remains 
the norm in private equity. Investors have pushed back on the 
some of the GP friendly terms in the contracts, so the implicit 
costs are not as large as they used to be, but the top line 2 
and 20 is still the prevalent form of investing.

When we apply some representative allocations to the types 
of funds in Exhibit 2, we see that even in economic terms, the 
Sharpe ratios are substantially better than the standard 60% 
global equities/40% global investment grade income. The 
appraised volatility is lower, as anticipated. The lower volatility 
for the very aggressive university endowment is substantial: 
from 14.1% to 9.9%.

As can be seen, the appraised volatilities of real estate, private 
equity, and infrastructure make them highly attractive relative 
to public asset classes. Instead by projecting economic risk we 
move these asset classes more in line with the overall return 
and risk trade-off we expect in the capital markets.

7.2. Managing cash flows
Along with adjusting for volatility to assess the trade-offs in 
return and risk, investors must grapple with the management 
of the commitment schedule for the cash flow alternatives 
(as well as gates and queues that occur with the semi-liquid 
asset classes). This means understanding the relationship 
between commitments and NAVs. If NAVs typically show 
only small premiums over cumulative contributions (I.e. they 
are marked at cost), we can use the projected contributions 
to estimate the amount of commitments necessary to reach 
target NAV levels. For example, in the cash flow figures given 
in Exhibit 11, we estimate that investors should have uncalled 
commitments around 55% of the targeted NAV the private 
equity portfolio. Thus, if a plan has a target of USD100 million 
in private equity, this plan should have about USD55 million of 
uncalled commitments.

7.3. Implementation and practical issues
It is one thing to design a strategic asset allocation with 
alternatives; it is another to implement them. They require 
a larger staff than other asset classes and a quick decision-
making structure. Co-commitment programs require yet more 
additional staff.

One element of staffing is legal review and monitoring of 
terms. The private nature of most of alternative assets means 
that there are few standard contractual terms. Issues are 
constantly arising – allocation of expenses, incentive and 
base-fee formulas, use of subscriptions lines of credit, and co-
investment terms – that demand expert legal evaluation.

Moreover, it requires a balance of process in governance, due 
diligence with nimble decision-making, which can be difficult 
when there are multiple stakeholders and public oversight. 
Perhaps that is why the endowment community has been 
so successful in implementing alternative portfolios: quick 
decision-making structures with wide authority given to the 
CIO to implement as attractive deals come along.

Small investors have several disadvantages and must out-
source some of the implementation and management. 
Minimum sizes and large search costs make it difficulty in 
achieving significant diversification not only cross-sectional, 
but across vintage years as well. Thus, they have large 
concentration risk as there is wide variation in results across 
funds. 

Investors often look at alternative investments searching 
for an immediate bump in return; however, the j-curve for 
many of the private capital assets means that the superior 
returns are delayed for a few years (about 5 to 7 years) until a 
portfolio matures and begins returning distributions. Investors 
can accelerate this by going in the secondary market, but they 
are also time-consuming, resource-intensive efforts which can 
still take many months to compete.

Another thorny problem in alternative investments is 
benchmarking and assessing performance. The cash flow 
nature of private equity, infrastructure and other closed-
end funds means that it can several years to build mature 
portfolios and move to target allocations. Proper assessment 
of performance is very dependent on adjusting for vintage 
year performance and even then, this is compounded by the 
lag in data reporting and the fact that it can take five to ten 
years to assess whether a fund was a success. Hedge funds 
are another area with huge benchmarking concerns. Often 
investors sent a simple benchmark related to cash rates (T-Bills 
+ 4%, for example) with volatility and correlation targets. 

Small investors are at a disadvantage in implementing 
alternative investments. First, they cannot afford the staff and 
expertise necessary, but additionally, given the 'lumpy' nature 
of the minimum investment size, it can be difficult to build 
properly diversified portfolios.

One area that we expect more innovation is in vehicle design 
that will allow these smaller investors – and potentially even 
retail investors – access to these markets.

8. Summary

The alternatives market has evolved over the last 30 years 
and has gained wide acceptance with investors. What was 
once obscure and mysterious, it now standard for many 
institutional investors. We now have enough experience to 
understand how they perform and react in different market 
environments.

The primary rationale for alternatives is their ability to improve 
the risk/reward relationship for investors – certainly on an 
appraised basis, but on an economic basis as well. Going 
forward, we believe that returns will be lower than their 
historic averages – but this is generally true of the public 
markets as well, particularly fixed income. The diversification 
benefit will remain and we continue to see more evolution 
and innovation in the marketplace.

One big caveat for many investors is implementation. 
Alternatives require higher levels of oversight and 
management than those offered in the public markets. The 
search and due diligence costs are high due to the closed-
end and/or private nature of many of the investments. These 
portfolios require sophisticated staffs to build and maintain 
these portfolios, or high out-sourcing costs.
