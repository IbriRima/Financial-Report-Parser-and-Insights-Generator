 Mounting selling pressure on commodities 

 
This week, almost all prices for essential commodities have corrected 
sharply. The price of the industrial metal copper, which is usually an 
important leading indicator of global industrial activity, plummeted by 
around 10% this week to its lowest level since December 2020. The price 
of crude oil (Brent) also corrected on world markets in the course of this 
week. It is thus only just above the price level seen before the outbreak of 
the war in Ukraine. Fortunately, the prices of important agricultural 
commodities, such as wheat, corn and soybeans have also dropped 
significantly. 
  
The deepening slump in cyclically sensitive commodities confirms the 
current weakening of sentiment indicators. All in all, these are signs that 
the growth momentum of the global economy is weakening. The decline 
in commodity prices should have a dampening effect on inflation in the 
Eurozone over time, although consumers in the Eurozone will only feel 
the decline to a lesser extent, due to the current weakness of the euro. 
Nevertheless, the drop in the oil price, for example, should have a direct 
dampening effect on the inflation dynamics of energy prices. 
Unfortunately, however, the unabated rise in gas and electricity prices 
currently poses an upside risk to the development of energy price inflation 
in the coming months. 
  
The current drastic decline in prices for industrial metals should gradually 
ease the tightness in the supply of goods, as demand is obviously 
declining significantly. This should reduce the pricing power of 
manufacturers, with a corresponding dampening effect on the inflation 
dynamics of goods. As a result of the collapse in prices for key agricultural 
commodities, the rise in food prices should also lose momentum in the 
near future. This is important for the inflation outlook for the Eurozone, 
after the accelerated rise in food prices in particular caused inflation to 
rise again to 8.6% y/y in June.  
 
The current weakness on global commodity markets is worsening the 
growth outlook for the Eurozone, especially for exports. However, falling 
commodity prices, especially for energy raw materials, should have a 
positive impact on the external trade balance. Due to the fall in raw 
material prices, the probability of falling inflation rates in the second half of 
the year has increased substantially. This should take pressure off the 
central banks and help calm the situation on the financial markets.
