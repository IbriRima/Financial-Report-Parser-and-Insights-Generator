Downside risks to growth building 

 
 
■ Global: GDP growth will probably slow to 3.0% this year (previously 3.3%) and 2.8% next 

year (from 3.4%). Headwinds from the Russia-Ukraine conflict have combined with COVID-
19 lockdowns in China to push inflation up further and slow the pace of economic activity. 
Central banks have become even more hawkish. Tighter financial conditions, a squeeze in 
real incomes and a sharp downturn in consumer confidence will increasingly weigh on 
activity. Trade is weakening, also reflecting a switching of expenditure away from goods. 
Global inflation will probably peak soon, but the speed and extent of the subsequent 
decline remains highly uncertain. We think that central banks and markets are 
underestimating the downside risks to growth. If Russian energy imports suddenly stop, 
much of Europe will likely see negative GDP growth for 2023. 

■ US: We forecast GDP growth of 2.4% this year and below-potential growth of 1.3% next 

year. Economic momentum is slowing, particularly for interest-rate-sensitive sectors such 
as housing and durable goods. CPI inflation will likely peak at about 9% yoy in 3Q22, with 
monthly inflation prints likely easing to levels consistent with target by around the turn of 
the year. Longer-run measures of inflation expectations are still well anchored and average 
hourly earnings growth is moderating. We expect the Fed to raise the target range for the 
federal funds rate into restrictive territory by the end of the year, to 3.25-3.50%, which we 
see as the peak. Rate cuts could start in late 2023. 

■ Eurozone: GDP is likely to expand by 2.8% this year and by 1.3% in 2023. Survey 

indicators signal a weakening of growth momentum in the spring and downside risks for 
economic activity in 2H22. Headline and core inflation have further to rise, although we see 
initial signs that pipeline price pressure might start easing soon from extremely high levels. 
Weak growth and slowing inflation will probably force the ECB to stop hiking in 1Q23 once 
the depo rate reaches 1.25%, i.e. the lower end of the 1-2% range the central bank regards 
as “neutral”. We expect the announcement of a credible anti-fragmentation facility featuring 
potentially unlimited purchases and light conditionality. 

■ CEE: The EU-CEE1 economies will likely grow on average by 3.6% in 2022 and 2.6% in 

2023, with the Western Balkans lagging. Turkey could grow by 4.4% in 2022 and 3.3% in 
2023. In Russia, the economy could shrink by around 10% this year and stall next year. 
Hungary and Slovakia would experience the biggest direct impact from a lack of Russian 
energy imports, followed by Bulgaria, Czechia and Serbia. Inflation is likely to peak this 
year in most CEE countries, except for Hungary and Poland, where the peak could be 
postponed to 2023. Inflation is expected to remain well above targets in 2023. We think 
that central banks will end rate hikes in the autumn, but the scope for rate cuts in 2023 is 
very limited. The CBR could cut the policy rate to 8% in 2022 and to 7% in 2023. The 
CBRT might hike in 2023 if there is a change in government. 

■ UK: We forecast GDP growth of 3.4% this year and 0.6% next year. The economy will be 

skating on the edge of recession for the next few quarters amid a big squeeze in real 
disposable income. Inflation is set to stay higher for longer in the UK compared to peers, 
peaking at above 9% yoy in 4Q22, but should fall quickly to below 2% by end-2023. The 
BoE will probably stop raising the bank rate after a final 25bp hike to 1.50% in August. 

■ China: GDP will likely grow by 4.0% in 2022 and by 4.2% in 2023. While most COVID-19-

related restrictions were lifted at the beginning of June, the supply side of the economy is 
recovering faster than the demand side as Chinese consumers continue their cautious 
behavior to avoid quarantines. The central government is stepping up efforts to support the 
economy and reduce the negative impact of future waves of contagion on the domestic 
economy through a combination of monetary and fiscal policy measures. The PBoC might 
tolerate further weakening of the CNY towards 7.00 against the USD to support exports.   

 

1 EU-CEE refers to CEE countries that are members of the EU: Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia.

■ We forecast that global GDP growth will slow to 3.0% this year (previously 3.3%) and 2.8% 

next year (previously 3.4%), down from 6.1% in 2021. Headwinds from the Russia-Ukraine 
conflict have combined with COVID-19 lockdowns in China to further push up inflation and 
weaken economic activity. Energy prices have continued to move higher, and supply-chain 
disruption continues. High inflation is squeezing real incomes, financial conditions have 
tightened and consumer confidence has fallen to – or near to – record-low levels both in 
Europe and the US. Business confidence has been more resilient but has started to 
weaken too. The more interest-rate-sensitive parts of the economy, including housing and 
business investment, are slowing. Our proprietary global leading indicator declined further 
and signals global trade to shrink by about 8% at an annualized rate at the start of 3Q22. 
Among the downside risks to growth, if Russian energy imports were to suddenly stop, 
much of Europe will likely see negative GDP growth for 2023. 

■ Inflation has continued to rise to multi-decade highs in many countries. This largely reflects 

rising prices for energy and food (food prices are a major contributor to inflation in 
emerging markets), but inflationary pressure is broadening and has affected prices for core 
services. The latter likely reflects the indirect effects of higher energy and food prices, tight 
labor markets, expenditure-switching towards services and a high pass-through from 
producer prices to consumer prices. We expect inflation to peak in the US and the 
eurozone by 3Q22, at 8.5-9%. Inflation will likely decline to around target levels by 2H23, 
driven by negative base effects, some easing of supply bottlenecks, expenditure-switching 
away from goods, slower GDP growth and our forecast for lower oil prices next year. 
Longer-run measures of inflation expectations remain well-anchored, and there is little or 
no sign of a wage-price spiral, even in the US, where inflation is more domestically driven. 

■ Central banks have stepped up actual or planned monetary policy tightening in response to 

sharply higher inflation and the risk that it could become entrenched via expectations. The 
Fed and the BoE have started shrinking their balance sheets, with the ECB set to end net 
asset purchases on 1 July. We expect the Fed to raise rates into restrictive territory to a 
peak of 3.5% by year-end, while we expect the ECB to raise its depo rate to 1.25% by next 
March. In both cases, this is less than financial markets expect. We think markets and 
central banks are underestimating downside risks to growth, which will likely cause central 
banks to pause or change course. The Fed could cut rates in late 2023.

■ We forecast GDP growth of 2.4% this year and below-potential growth of 1.3% next year. 

There is a non-negligible risk of a technical recession. The economy contracted 0.4% qoq 
(non-annualized) in 1Q22, but the decline was driven by volatile net exports and 
inventories, while personal consumption and investment expanded robustly. We expect 
GDP to grow by 0.7% qoq in 2Q22 before easing steadily to 0.2% qoq in 2Q23 and 3Q23. 
The more interest-rate-sensitive parts of the economy are softening amid a tightening of 
financial conditions. Mortgage approvals are down 25% and existing home sales are down 
17% compared to January levels. Business investment is softening, likely partly reflecting 
heightened uncertainty. Personal consumption has held up so far despite the squeeze in 
real income, as households draw down on their excess savings. However, this resilience in 
spending seems unlikely to last, amid low consumer confidence and tightening financial 
conditions. Disappointing retail sales in May already point to some weakness setting in. 

■ CPI inflation rose to a stronger-than-expected 8.6% yoy in May, while core CPI inflation 

eased to 6.0% yoy. On a monthly basis, core CPI inflation rose a strong 0.6% mom and 
was broad-based, with core goods inflation rebounding. We expect CPI inflation to peak at 
around 9% yoy in 3Q22 and to remain well above 2% through mid-2023, but monthly 
inflation prints will likely ease to around 0.2% mom in 4Q22 as commodity prices stabilize, 
core goods inflation declines (driven by expenditure-switching to services and some 
improvement in supply constraints) and domestically-driven inflationary pressure begins to 
ease as the economy cools. Longer-run measures of inflation expectations are still well 
anchored and average hourly earnings growth is already moderating. 

■ In June, the Fed raised the target range for the federal funds rate by a supersized 75bp to 

1.5-1.75%, while the “dot plot” signaled another 175bp before year-end and a further 50bp 
by end-2023. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said a hike by either 75bp or 50bp at the FOMC’s 
next meeting on 26-27 July is likely. We expect 50bp hikes in July, September and 
November, as the Fed wants to see a series of declining monthly inflation readings before 
declaring victory. A final hike of 25bp in December seems likely, taking the target range to 
3.25-3.50%, less than financial markets expect. We do not see the Fed continuing to hike 
rates next year, given our forecasts for subdued growth and a decline in monthly inflation 
readings to around 0.2% mom. The full impact on the economy of rate hikes will not 
materialize for 18-24 months, given the lags. Once the Fed stops hiking, the next Fed 
policy rate move is likely to be downwards, probably starting in late 2023.

■ GDP is likely to expand by 2.8% this year and by 1.3% in 2023. At 0.6% qoq, growth was 

surprisingly strong in 1Q22, but more than half of the increase reflected a big jump in Irish 
GDP (+10.8% qoq), which is likely to be at least partly reversed going forward. Instead, 
performance in the largest countries of the eurozone was weak as GDP expanded only 
moderately in Germany, Italy and Spain, while it contracted slightly in France. Survey 
indicators have pointed to a weaking of growth momentum in the spring. Tighter financial 
conditions are weighing on activity, compounding the erosion of real incomes amid high 
inflation and the effect of uncertainty surrounding energy supply and the evolution of the 
conflict in Ukraine. The flash PMIs for June suggest that growth might be weakening 
sooner and more quickly than expected.  

■ Manufacturing activity seems to be under increased pressure as global trade is 

deteriorating. The services sector is still benefitting from the reopening of the economy, 
although the boost might be starting to fade as high prices accelerate the exhaustion of 
pent-up demand. Surging inflation has pushed consumer confidence to extremely low 
levels, only marginally above the record-low hit during the first pandemic wave.  

■ Headline and core inflation have further to rise. The former might peak soon at just above 

8.5% yoy, assuming that retail prices of electricity and natural gas start declining 
moderately during the summer. If this expectation does not materialize, the peak might be 
in September at around 9%. After averaging 7.5% this year, headline inflation will probably 
slow meaningfully next year to 2.7%, with a decline below 2% in 2H23. Survey indicators 
suggest that underlying price pressure might have finally started to ease from extremely 
high levels, more so in manufacturing than in services. We expect core inflation to peak at 
around 4.3% in the fall and then slow to about 2% by end-2023. This forecast assumes 
that the growth rate of negotiated wages will accelerate to about 3%. 

■ The ECB is likely to raise rates by a cumulative 175bp in this cycle, starting with a 25bp 

hike in July followed by a 50bp move in September and increases of 25bp per meeting until 
next March. Weak growth and slowing inflation will probably force the central bank to stop 
hiking when the depo rate reaches 1.25%, i.e. the lower end of the 1-2% range the ECB 
regards as “neutral”, and well below market expectations. We expect the ECB to announce 
a credible anti-fragmentation facility featuring potentially unlimited purchases and light 
conditionality. This would allow the central bank to prevent measurable tensions in the 
sovereign space without having to activate the tool, although spreads are unlikely to 
narrow to levels that prevailed before the ECB’s hawkish pivot in February.

■ We expect real GDP to rise 1.6% yoy in 2022 and 1.8% in 2023, each on a non-working-

day adjusted basis. In the second half of 2022, economic activity is still likely to remain 
below its pre-COVID-19 level before finally exceeding it in 1Q23. One major critical 
uncertainty, especially for the 2023 outlook, is the (potential) lack of natural gas from 
Russia and its impact on GDP. Especially the chemical sector as key input provider for 
other industries could be negatively affected, which then may ripple through the economy. 

■ For the time being, the major headwinds to stronger growth continue to be higher energy 

prices, weaker global trade and persistent supply shortages. Especially the latter factor has 
remained a substantial drag on economic activity, as the German manufacturing sector has 
accumulated a record-high level of backlog orders but cannot work them off due to missing 
input goods. In 2Q22, manufacturers said that already collected orders equal 4.5 months of 
production activity. In the auto industry, it even stood at 7½ months. Furthermore, the 
supply shortages have prevented a normalization of the still very low inventory levels, 
which would have additionally lifted production.  

■ We forecast consumer prices will increase 7.5% yoy in 2022 and 3.7% in 2023. Inflationary 

pressure may peak in September but is likely to remain elevated until year-end 2022 before 
gradually receding. In September, the relief package of the government in the form of lower 
gasoline and diesel prices will expire, which might then lead to a spike in consumer price 
inflation to nearly 8½% yoy. Currently, there are discussions in the traffic-light coalition 
regarding further fiscal relief and how to fund it, as a return to the debt brake in 2023 is 
officially anticipated.  

■ The strong rise in tariff wages to 4.3% yoy in 1Q22 from 1.5% in the previous quarter was 

largely caused by one-off effects in the form of special payments and COVID-19-related 
bonuses. By contrast, basic compensation adjusted for such effects increased by only 
1.6% yoy. However, going forward, the risk of second-round effects in inflation through 
higher wages remains non-negligible. Recently, the labor union IG Metall demanded a wage 
hike of 7-8% on a 12-month basis. The collective bargaining round, which covers about 
3.8mn employees in key industries such as auto and machinery, is likely to start in mid-
September. Further negotiations are expected in the chemical industry in October (0.6mn 
employees) and in the public (2.7mn) and temporary-work (0.8mn) sectors, each probably 
in 1Q23. Further upward pressure on wages might stem from the increase in the statutory 
minimum wage to EUR 12 per hour in October, which was recently passed by the 
Bundestag.

■ GDP is likely to rise by 2.4% in 2022 and by 1.4% in 2023. Following a moderate 

contraction in 1Q22, GDP growth is likely to re-accelerate from 2Q22 but remain below 
trend on average. Private and public consumption are likely to remain the main contributors 
to GDP growth, mitigating deceleration in investment following strong performance 
recorded last year. Risks to our forecasts are tilted to the downside, as the latest survey 
data suggest that growth prospects are weakening faster than expected. PMI data for June 
point to a significant loss of momentum in the manufacturing sector, with production falling 
into contraction territory for the first time since October 2021, amid easing demand and 
persistent supply-side disruptions. Meanwhile, services activity has expanded further, but 
its rate of growth has slowed significantly as soaring prices negatively affect demand.  

■ We expect inflation to average 5.2% in 2022 and 3.3% in 2023. Inflation is likely to peak 

around 6.5% in September, driven by prices for non-energy goods (including food) and 
services, reflecting the surge in producer prices and the consecutive revaluations of the 
gross hourly minimum wage (SMIC). Our forecast assumes that the government rebate on 
fuel prices will be terminated in August and be replaced by more targeted measures, as 
announced by the government.  

■ After the electoral setback in the legislative election in mid-June, in which presidential 

coalition Ensemble obtained only 245 seats (out of 577), President Emmanuel Macron 
faces a serious political impasse that threatens to jeopardize his reform program. Mr. 
Macron retains control of the government, but he will have to seek the support of other 
parties to pass legislation through parliament. Mr. Macron has identified deputies from The 
Republicans party (LR) on the center-right to deputies from the Communist party on the 
left, as those who could potentially support the government in implementing his agenda. 
He explicitly ruled out any possible agreement with the far-right National Rally (RN) or the 
far-left France Unbowed (LFI). In fact, LR is the most obvious ally, as it shares many 
similar positions to Ensemble. However, LR is deeply divided, and many members think 
that the party’ chances of rebuilding its strength ahead of the 2027 presidential election 
would be undermined if it were too closely associated with Mr. Macron. Recent statements 
by the new parliamentary head of LR suggest that the most likely scenario is that the party 
will support the government on some issues but only on a case-by-case basis, which could 
lengthen negotiations to pass legislation and ultimately make decision-making rather 
problematic. Should the political system end up in a deadlock, Mr. Macron could call for a 
new election. However, this could prove risky unless he demonstrates that he has strongly 
fought to reach a consensus in the national interest.

■ We expect real GDP to increase by 2.9% in 2022 and by 1.1% in 2023. In the first quarter, 

GDP expanded by 0.1% qoq, and was back to its pre-pandemic level (4Q19).  

■ Industrial production surprised to the upside, expanding by 1.6% mom in April. Manufacturing 

output is now more than 4% above its pre-pandemic level, as firms benefited from a rebound 
in demand and were less affected by supply-side bottlenecks. Still, starting from May, we 
expect to see a deterioration as energy costs remain high, global demand is slowing and 
financing conditions are tightening. In the short term, such weakness is expected to be partly 
offset by a recovery in services activity, especially in the hospitality sector, which is likely to 
catch up to its pre-pandemic level in the spring/summer. This is suggested by the rapid 
recovery in high-frequency mobility trackers and the improvement in sentiment in the services 
and retail sectors, while the services PMI hints at an easing in the pace of expansion. We 
project that real GDP will then continue to expand at a modest pace, as the uncertainty related 
to the Russia-Ukraine conflict will weigh on private-sector confidence (also due to the risk of 
persistently high energy and food prices), and that the negative impulse from worsening 
financing conditions will become more entrenched, especially from next year. 

■ Total employment has recovered so far broadly in line with economic activity (it is close to its 

4Q19 level). Therefore, its growth is also expected to moderate in the coming months. We also 
expect to see recourse to short-time work schemes increasing again, following the significant 
reduction observed in the last few months. This will slow the recovery of both total hours 
worked and full-time-equivalent employment to pre-pandemic levels. Still-large labor market 
slack is likely to mitigate wage pressure. 

■ The government received strong support from parliament in a vote ahead of the European 

Council on 23-24 June. The votes in favor amounted to about 70% of the total seats in the 
Senate and 65% in the lower house. This very large majority is an indication of the stability of 
Mario Draghi’s government and its ability to deliver, despite a likely increase in political 
uncertainty ahead of the general election. Indeed, on the same day, there was a formal split 
within the Five Star Movement (M5S), with the foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, creating a new 
group in parliament. While this new group will firmly support Mr. Draghi’s government, a more 
critical view towards it is rising within the M5S, especially with regard to weapons being sent in 
support of Ukraine. M5S leader, Giuseppe Conte, has confirmed his party’s commitment to 
supporting the government, but the evolution of the conflict will probably test this. As the 
economic fallout from the conflict intensifies, it will become more costly for all political parties in 
the ruling coalition to withdraw their support, in our view.

INFLATION 
  PPI 

 

 

 

■ We expect CPI inflation to remain above 6% for the rest of 2022, 

with energy and food prices remaining the largest contributors.  

 
■ In line with its eurozone peers, core PPI growth followed a steep 

upward trend. We project that a peak will be reached in 3Q22.  

CONSUMER CONFIDENCE 
  DOMESTIC DEMAND 

 

 

 

■ The Russia-Ukraine conflict and its effect on inflation is weighing 

significantly on consumer sentiment. The impact on service 
spending is partly mitigated by the availability of savings. 

 
■ The private-consumption dynamic is the main concern going 

forward, as consumption is still 4% below its pre-pandemic level, 
in contrast to the buoyant recovery seen in fixed investment. 

LENDING 
 
BAD LOANS 

 

 

 

■ Lending to the private sector has been growing at a good pace so 

far, ahead of the normalization of monetary policy by the ECB.  

 
■ The stock of bad loans (sofferenze) has reached a new all-time 

low. This bodes well for the resilience of the banking system.

■ GDP is likely to grow by 4.1% in 2022 and by 2.6% in 2023. Economic activity was 

significantly impacted by the spread of the Omicron variant from the end of last year 
through the beginning of 1Q22, with tourist and recreational activities hit especially hard. 
The lifting of most restrictions in mid-February allowed the services sector to recover lost 
ground but the shortfall from pre-pandemic levels for some industries, particularly those 
more exposed to customer interaction, is likely to have remained substantial in 2Q22. 
Although Spain is less directly exposed to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the war, along with 
rising inflationary pressures, took its toll on economic activity by eroding household 
purchasing power and consumer confidence. However, a strong labor market and the 
savings buffer built up during the pandemic are likely to partly shelter private consumption 
through the rest of the year. Further stimulus to economic growth is expected from the 
implementation of the RRP.    

■ Consumer inflation is likely to have passed the peak at around 10%. Energy prices in Spain 

have increased faster than in most eurozone economies. Going forward, government 
interventions in the form of fuel discounts, cuts to the value-added tax on power bills, and the 
cap on wholesale gas prices should help to bring down inflation in 2H22. The cap on the gas 
price is expected to reduce consumer inflation by 0.4 to 0.7pp for this year. Overall, assuming 
the lower bound of the range will apply, we expect HICP inflation to come in at 8.5% in 2022 
and 2.7% in 2023. At the time of writing, the Sanchez government is working on a package to 
tax power firms’ windfall profits. 

■ The labor market remains in good shape. The ERTE short-term work schemes contained 

the job losses during the pandemic and the reopening of the economy allowed the 
unemployment rate to decline fast, reaching 13.6% in early 2022 (the lowest level since 
2008), with the youth especially supported. Part of the improvement in the labor market is 
due to the recent reform that, as part of commitments to receive EU recovery funds, limits 
the legal use of temporary contracts and promotes employment protection schemes such 
as furloughs to avoid permanent layoffs. 

■ The political landscape in Spain is changing fast. At the last regional elections in 

Andalusia, the PP won an absolute majority (58 seats out of the 55 needed), defeating the 
center-left coalitions. The renewed popularity of the PP is also evident at the national level, 
with polls pointing to preferences close to 30%. This is partly due to the implosion of 
Ciudadanos. The far-right Vox is also gaining momentum with preferences close to 20%. 
Both Podemos and the PSOE, meanwhile, are losing their grip on the electorate.

■ GDP rose significantly, by 1.5% qoq in the first quarter of 2022, supported by the easing of 

restrictions in the services sector and a strong performance from construction and industry. 
However, since the start of the war in Ukraine, sentiment in the economy has deteriorated 
significantly and we expect a noticeable dampener on economic activity. After the very 
strong start to the year, we forecast economic growth of 4.4% for 2022 as a whole. For 
2023, we expect GDP growth to slow to 1.5%. 

■ The UniCredit Bank Austria Business Indicator fell to minus 0.1 points in May, dropping into 

negative territory for the first time in 15 months. Economic sentiment cooled in all sectors of 
the economy. In construction, and especially industry, falling new orders already point to a 
significant slowdown in business development. In the services sector, where trade and the 
hospitality industry are benefiting from the easing of pandemic measures, the mood has 
worsened only slightly so far. However, consumer confidence, which is now declining 
sharply, also points to a slower pace of growth in services, burdened by high inflation.  

■ The slowdown in the economy is leaving its first traces on the Austrian labor market. The 

seasonally adjusted unemployment rate, which had been declining in large steps over the 
last few months, remained unchanged in May compared to April, at 6.2%. Due to the very 
favorable development so far, we expect the unemployment rate to fall to an annual 
average of 6.3% in 2022. For 2023, we expect only a slight decline to 6.1%.  

■ Due to persistently high energy prices, inflation in Austria will not decline to around 6% 

year-on-year until the end of the year. Inflation should therefore average at 6.8% for this 
year, about one percentage point above our previous expectations. We have raised our 
inflation forecast for 2023 to an average of 2.7%. 

■ In June, the Austrian government launched a third package to cushion the impact of high 

inflation. The one-off payments to households cost about EUR 5bn. Direct subsidies and 
electricity price compensation payments for energy-intensive companies of EUR 1bn are 
planned for 2022. In addition, long-term measures such as the reduction of non-wage labor 
costs, the annual valorization of social benefits and, above all, the abolition of the so-called 
“cold progression” through adjustments in the income tax system are planned for 2023. 
While we do not expect this to have a significant impact on the level of inflation, we have 
raised our forecast for the 2023 budget deficit by about one percentage point to 2.5%. 
However, due to the good revenue performance so far, our budget forecast for 2022 
remains unchanged.

INFLATION 
   UNEMPLOYMENT RATE 

 

 

 

■ Inflation will be between 7% and 8% yoy in the coming months 

as a result of the war in Ukraine. From the second half of the 
year, inflation can be expected to slow down via energy prices.  

 
■ The situation on the labor market should continue to improve, 

although at a slower pace as a result of the Ukraine crisis.  

EXPORT AND IMPORT VOLUMES  
   CURRENT ACCOUNT BALANCE  

 

 

 

■ Due to the increase in energy prices, a large gap has emerged 

between imports and exports.  

 
■ Price-related high energy imports will again cause a current 

account deficit in 2022 despite an improvement in service exports. 

TAX REVENUES 
 
PUBLIC FINANCES  

 

 

 

■ In the first four months of 2022, tax revenues increased by 17.9% 

year-on-year. Corporate income tax, personal income tax and VAT 
saw above-average revenue increases.  

 
■ Due to the good tax-revenue performance, the budget deficit will 

decrease significantly in 2022 and will allow for a stronger 
reduction of total public debt as a percentage of GDP.

■ We expect GDP growth of 3.8% in 2022 and 1.4% in 2023. Following an unexpectedly 

large surge in 1Q22 (by 2.4% qoq), GDP growth is likely to show a technical correction in 
2Q22, before accelerating again in the summer driven by a solid recovery in tourism. Early 
indications for tourism show that Greece is heading for a strong season. 

■ In the period January-April, non‑resident arrivals and associated receipts increased 

significantly, reaching 73% and 87% of the respective levels in the same period in 2019. 
Export growth is also likely to remain solid due to strong transport services, especially 
shipping, which has become more important in transferring Russian oil since the outbreak 
of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Shipping prospects remain well-supported by the fact that 
the Greek government succeeded in removing the ban on EU-owned tankers carrying 
Russian oil to non-EU destinations from the (EC) European Commission’s proposals for 
the sixth package of sanctions. Final domestic demand is expected to continue to 
contribute to GDP. A large amount of savings accumulated during the pandemic, 
government support measures and favorable labor dynamics supporting labor income are 
likely to cushion the negative effects on private consumption of soaring prices and rising 
uncertainty. The deployment of RRF funding should continue to support investment, 
although supply bottlenecks and rising prices may delay the start of new projects.  

■ Inflation hit double digits in May, reflecting strong upward pressure on food and transport 

prices. In response to the recent spike, the government extended and increased a monthly 
subsidy that was introduced earlier this year to cushion the impact of soaring fuel prices. 
The new subsidy should allow the price of gasoline to be reduced to below EUR 2 per liter 
for everyone who has qualified for state support, easing pressure on transport prices. 
Accordingly, we expect inflation to peak in 3Q22, although it is then likely to moderate only 
gradually, before slowing more significantly in 2023. 

■ On 17 June, the Eurogroup officially accepted an EC recommendation to end Greece's 

enhanced economic surveillance, acknowledging that the country has fulfilled the bulk of its 
policy commitments. The exit from enhanced surveillance, combined with the full 
repayment of IMF loans and the earlier abolition of capital controls bring an end to the very 
difficult period for Greece that began in 2010. All these factors will be considered as credit-
positive events by rating agencies, as the Greek government promptly pointed out. 
However, we think that only a sustainable improvement in the country’s growth prospects 
is likely to lead agencies to upgrade the sovereign credit rating back to investment grade.

■ We expect GDP to increase by 5.3% in 2022 and by 1.3% in 2023. After a strong 

acceleration (2.6% qoq) in 1Q22, growth is likely to slow down in 2Q22 due, among other 
factors, to a technical correction in private consumption. However, growth momentum 
seems to have remained more resilient than originally expected, as the reopening of the 
economy continues to boost services growth and to partly offset weakening manufacturing 
activity. The European Commission services confidence survey hit an all-time high in May, 
most likely reflecting the ongoing strong recovery in tourism from a low base in the 
previous year. A strong tourism season is likely to support a moderate re-acceleration of 
GDP growth in 3Q22 before a new slowdown sets in towards year-end. Risks to our 
forecasts are to the downside amid tighter financing conditions and the incomplete 
recovery of activity and profitability across many sectors of the economy. 

■ On 14 June, the exceptional regime for setting prices in the Iberian electricity market came 

into force. In practice, the mechanism establishes an artificial ceiling on the cost of the gas 
used by fossil-fuel-based power plants to generate electricity. The reference price is set at 
EUR40/MWh until December 2022 and will then be increased by EUR 5/MWh each month 
for the following five months until it reaches EUR 65/MWh in May 2023. The affected power 
plants (which operate at higher costs) will be reimbursed the difference between the price of 
natural gas on the Iberian gas market and the reference price. While no official estimate is yet 
available, the impact of the gas price cap on Portuguese inflation should be smaller than in 
Spain, where it is estimated at between -0.4 and -0.7pp for this year. Gas prices faced by the 
Spanish consumer have been more aligned with the prices observed in the wholesale market 
than in Portugal (and this also explains why they have increased more). 

■ On 27 May, the Portuguese parliament approved the 2022 budget law in a final vote with 

the support of the absolute majority held by the ruling Socialist party (PS). The adoption of 
the budget law was delayed for more than six months after negotiations on the text broke 
down in October and led to snap general elections in late January, in which the PS won an 
absolute majority. The updated budget law contains no significant changes from the 
original draft. Notably, the government refused to support the call for further salary 
increases for civil servants. The only prominent additions were the new discretionary 
measures to mitigate the impact of energy inflation, which include a combination of tax 
breaks and new subsidies to firms and households. The impact of these measures will be 
to lower tax revenues by 0.3% of GDP and to increase expenditure by 0.5%. Overall, with 
the government having made only minor revisions to the original budget draft and the state 
budget having performed well to date, we feel confident in our expectation that the 2022 
deficit target of 1.9% is within reach.

GDP 
PRIVATE CONSUMPTION   

 

 

 

■ We expect GDP to increase by 5.3% in 2022 and 1.3% in 2023.  
■ The strong acceleration in private consumption in 1Q22 was 

driven by spending on non-durable goods and services. 

INFLATION 
EMPLOYMENT 

 

 

 

■ Consumer inflation rose from 7.2% to 8.0% yoy in May, amid 

soaring prices for food and housing, notably utilities  

 
■ Employment firmly accelerated in 1Q22 following the surge in 

GDP growth. 

GOODS EXPORTS 
 
HOUSEHOLD VULNERABILITY TO SOARING PRICES 

 

 

 

■ Goods exports have remained resilient in the aftermath of the 

Russia-Ukraine conflict as Russia is not among Portugal’s major 
trading partners. 

 
■ Low-income households are relatively more vulnerable to price 

increases in Portugal than in many peer countries.

 ■ Parliamentary elections are 16 months away, but they loom large over politics and policies in 

Poland. While the ruling United Right is still leading in opinion polls, high inflation threatens the 
government’s popularity. In January, the government launched the Anti-Inflation Shield (AIS), a 
program including subsidies and tax cuts on rapidly rising prices, such as those for food, 
electricity, natural gas and fuel. The government estimated that the AIS has lowered inflation by 
1.5-2pp. We expect the AIS to be kept in place until after parliamentary elections, despite 
lacking any disinflationary effect. Additional tax cuts for low earners, tax deductions for 
unmarried parents, children and SMEs, more subsidies and a fourteenth pension could push the 
budget deficit to around 4% of GDP in 2022-23, from 1.9% of GDP in 2021. Public debt below 
50% of GDP by next year. 

■ We expect headline inflation to peak at over 15% in July and to decline to around 13% by the 

end of the year. If gas prices are increased by around 20% next year, inflation could fall to single 
digits between May and November, only to return above 11% (the highest in EU-CEE) if the AIS 
tax cuts are removed in December 2023. The NBP will have to continue hiking interest rates. We 
expect the policy rate to be taken to 7% or higher by October if fiscal policy continues to boost 
domestic demand.    

■ Higher spending will receive a boost from more transfers and loans from the EU and from IFIs. 

Poland is set to receive EUR 23.9bn in grants and EUR 11.5bn in loans from the RRF. 
Prepayments of up to EUR 4.5bn could arrive later this year or in early 2023. The government 
expects more than EUR 6bn next year, but it may struggle to achieve all the necessary reforms to 
unlock the funds in an election year. Poland can access the lion’s share of the EUR 3.5bn the EU 
made available to support Ukrainian refugees and stands to receive EUR 2bn in loans from the 
EIB for the same reason. Of the approximately 4.2mn Ukrainian refugees arriving in Poland, 1.2-
1.5mn remain in the country. Of the 1.1mn eligible to work, around 240,000 have found jobs, 
mostly part time. At the time of writing, there were more Ukrainians returning home than arriving in 
Poland. 

■ Economic growth could decline to 4.2% this year and to 2.8% in 2023. Consumption is likely to 

remain the biggest driver of growth. Real wage growth might dip below inflation this year, but tax 
cuts and handouts will supplement household income. Construction will benefit from larger 
public investment and demand for real estate being boosted by poor performance of alternative 
financial investments. Labor shortages raise the risk of a wage-inflation spiral. We expect the 
C/A deficit to widen further to 2.1% of GDP this year and 2.5% of GDP in 2023, fully covered by 
FDI and EU transfers.

■ The waning momentum in the post-pandemic recovery and a sharp adjustment in household 

spending due to an inflation spike characterize the current environment. In April, industrial 
output fell by 3.8% yoy, deepening its contraction from the -0.4% seen in 1Q22. The 
automotive sector was largely to blame for this. Leading indicators for industry have been 
showing mixed signals recently. Foreign trade swung to a CZK 28bn deficit from a CZK 19bn 
surplus in April 2021 due to lower car exports, and the import of several times more expensive 
oil and gas. Construction output was up 2.6% yoy in April despite infrastructure building 
dropping. Retail sales increased by 5.0% yoy in April, but the base was impacted by the 
pandemic. In June, consumer confidence fell to the lowest reading on record. 

■ GDP growth could weaken further in 2H22. Households are facing a considerable loss of real 

income as inflation rises and is likely to be stickier than previously expected. Business 
investment is set to slow, as companies are hesitant to start new projects in an environment of 
weaker economic activity (except perhaps in residential building and energy saving). Exports 
will be impeded from the supply side by the ongoing value-chain disruption in the automotive 
industry and from the demand side due to deteriorating business confidence in Europe. Czech 
exports to Russia are expected to remain depressed. Furthermore, GDP will no longer be 
supported by inventory accumulation. A drawdown in inventories seems inevitable as 
borrowing costs rise, although its pace remains uncertain. 

■ Inflation is viewed as the most important drag on economic growth. In the production sector, 

price pressure is dominated by energy, however double-digit growth is observed across the 
board. We expect CPI to tick up further in June, peaking at between 16% and 17% yoy. While 
in 2H22, the base effect will start working against a further rise, its power may be just enough 
to stabilize annual inflation rather than bringing it down. We now believe that inflation will 
remain well above the target in 2023, as second-round effects of past price changes could 
combine with fresh shocks. However, as a substantial change, 2023 inflation will no longer be 
driven by demand. Wage growth will react to higher inflation with a delay due to corporate 
policies and government efforts to slow down wages in the public sector. 

■ An expected deterioration in 2023 GDP would likely prevent the CZK from appreciating and 

the koruna will also have to factor in a wider C/A deficit and a narrowing CZK-EUR interest 
rate spread when the ECB starts tightening. Our revised view of the CZK value is at odds with 
the ČNB’s policy assumptions, questioning the timing of a reversal in monetary policy. 
Currently, we expect a first rate cut in 3Q23. It is also uncertain whether the June 2022 repo 
rate level of 7% represents the peak. The ČNB is expected to continue employing FX 
interventions in times of market stress but not as a regular tool to tame inflation.

MANUFACTURING PMI – INPUT AND OUTPUT PRICES 
CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION 

 

 

 

■ A rise in input prices was registered by 95% of businesses 

covered by PMI in 2021, while the latest share is still around 
85%. Most businesses manage to pass on the extra cost to their 
output prices. 

 
■ The high yoy dynamic of private spending stemmed from the 

base effect of the COVID-19 era. The end to that driver, 
alongside the inflation spike, points to a sharp downward 
adjustment in private spending. 

NUMBER OF VACANCIES STILL HIGHER THAN UNEMPLOYED 
PPI GROUPS WITH THE HIGHEST GROWTH IN MAY 2022 

 

 

 

■ The number of vacancies still exceeds the number of 

unemployed in official statistics. The refugee wave from Ukraine 
is bringing down the former without the latter rising. 

 
■ Energy continues to be the key driver for producer prices. Apart 

from this, wood and chemicals belong to the list of products with 
the highest price hikes, as well as grain. 

KORUNA LED BY THE VOLATILITY INDEX VIX UNTIL JUNE 
 
NON-RESIDENT HOLDINGS OF CZ GOVERNMENT BONDS 

 

 

 

■ EUR-CZK was tracking the stock market volatility index, VIX, in 

the first month of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Since June, 
however, the ČNB’s FX interventions have been maintaining a 
floor to EUR-CZK.  

 
■ Since 2020, demand for Czech government bonds has been 

driven especially by domestic investors, mostly local banks.

■ After winning a fourth consecutive election, the government needs to tighten public 

spending or face further inflationary and financial pressure. The budget deficit rose to 4.2% 
of GDP in May, while the 12-month rolling budget deficit was 11.1% of GDP, just 0.4% of 
GDP from the pandemic high. The government announced a fiscal consolidation package 
equivalent to around 3% of GDP. 40% (HUF 815bn) is to come from sectoral taxes and the 
rest from lower government spending: the equivalent of 1% of GDP from line ministries and 
0.5% of GDP from public investment. Spending cuts might be difficult to achieve due to 
large subsidies for utilities and energy (equivalent to ca. 2% of GDP) and due to the rising 
number of ministries that can spend independently. Thus, budget deficits could be larger 
than the government expects in both 2022 (5.2% of GDP vs. 4.9% of GDP) and 2023 
(4.1% of GDP vs. 3.5% of GDP). We expect public debt to fall to 74% of GDP next year.  

■ Economic growth is likely to amount to around 4.7% in 2022 due to the strong carryover 

from 2021 (4.4pp), frontloading in private consumption and strong building activity. 
Hungarian households still had the equivalent of around 4% of GDP in precautionary 
savings at the end of April, and this could prop up the residential housing market, which is 
already the most overheated in CEE, and delay a potential spending slowdown brought 
about by higher inflation. In addition, real wage growth might remain positive this year due 
to tight labor-market conditions and government measures to cap inflation. Hungary is one 
of the few EU-CEE countries where labor shortages could cause an inflation-wage spiral. 

■ The government has imposed price caps on fuels and some foodstuffs, temporarily cut 

some indirect taxes and has not raised regulated prices for energy and heating. As a 
result, authorities estimate that inflation is 4-5pp lower than it would be in a free-price 
environment. If the government removes price caps and raises gas and electricity prices 
next year, inflation could end 2022 close to 13% and fall subsequently to around 10% by 
the end of 2023. If neither measure is implemented, inflation could end 2023 around 7%, at 
the cost of a larger budget deficit equivalent to around 5% of GDP.  

■ The NBH pledged to raise rates further in 2H22. We expect the policy rate to peak around 

9.5%. More rate hikes and tighter financial conditions are in the pipeline if the government 
fails to adjust the budget deficit in line with plans. The NBH might cut the policy rate to 
around 6.5% in 2H23. FX interventions are likely if EUR-HUF threatens to exceed 400 
again. We expect RRF funds to be unlocked before year-end, but disbursements could be 
interrupted if additional reforms are not implemented.

 ■ Western sanctions have dealt an expectedly large blow to the Russian economy and financial 

system, but so far, both seem to be coping better than expected. Economic activity is 
stabilizing (albeit at a subdued level) after a sharp initial downturn, and financial markets have 
calmed. The RUB has appreciated to its strongest level since 2017 thanks to efficient capital 
controls and to a widening trade surplus. However, such currency strength looks 
unsustainable, and the longer-term implications of a sharp shift in relations with the West are 
only just starting to kick in and are not likely to be fully felt until next year and beyond. 

■ A freefall in imports has been driven by logistical bottlenecks and sanctions-related payment 

difficulties. Output in sectors where import substitution is difficult or where assembly and 
maintenance are outsourced to foreign companies would decrease. Some formerly foreign-
owned companies are likely to re-open, e.g. in services, such as restaurants and catering, 
which do not require significant foreign inputs. Local regulation does not allow activity to stop 
without meaningful economic reasons (as it would hurt local employees). Thus, the role of 
Asian investors in the Russian economy is likely to increase. The severing of existing supply 
chains would force Russia to substitute imports from NATO countries with local production or 
other imports. 

■ The decline in Russia’s oil and fuel output could reach 3mn b/d by the end of the year if the EU 

implements a partial embargo on Russian crude oil and petroleum products. Until then, exports 
are likely to remain high, contributing to RUB strength. Rerouting some Russian oil exports 
from Europe to Asia is likely, but the same is not likely to apply to gas due to a lack of 
infrastructure. Hence, USD-RUB could climb to around 80 by year-end as imports recover, 
capital controls are loosened and the productivity shock affects relative prices. 

■ Russia’s monetary authorities have been highly active since March. As inflation moderated, the 

CBR cut its policy rate by 10.5pp to the pre-crisis level of 9.5%, with another 150bp in cuts 
expected before the end of the year. The CBR seems to have a strong mandate to bring 
inflation to 4% in 2024, implying a more prudent approach from here on. Financial conditions 
remain tight, as banks have imposed additional requirements on potential borrowers. 
According to the CBR, this will be considered when the level of interest rates is decided, with 
the key rate likely to be cut to 7% in 2023.  

■ Going forward, economic growth will depend on the success of substituting imports from the 

West. Some supply chains might be rebuilt at the cost of presumably lower potential growth. 
GDP will probably decline by about 10% in 2022, with domestic demand expected to fall by 
13%. In 2023, GDP could stagnate if supply bottlenecks offset a rebound in domestic demand 
driven by looser financial conditions and a return to real wage growth.

GDP 
LABOR MARKET 

 

 

 

■ Seasonally adjusted GDP showed a rapid recovery after the 

pandemic.  

 
■ The labor market still does not reflect worsening of the economic 

conditions, yet some deterioration is inevitable.  

CAPITAL OUTFLOW 
MONEY-MARKET RATES 

 

 

 

■ Capital outflows increased rapidly in 2H21. 
 
■ The CBR hiked its key rate to 20% to ensure financial stability, 

yet now the situation has stabilized, and so the key rate was put 
back, with some more easing to come.  

BUDGET BALANCE 
 
STATE FUNDS ACCUMULATION 

 

 

 

■ The federal budget recovered to a positive zone amid withdrawal 

of support for the economy higher oil prices. 

 
■ The National Wealth Fund fell in February to reflect a change in 

the illiquid part of investments (e.g. in shares of Sberbank), yet 
its liquid part is large at ca USD 112bn and is ready for spending.

■ We have revised our growth forecast for this year from 4% to 4.4%, mainly due to the large 

carry-over implied by 1Q22 GDP for the rest of the year (4.1pp). A possible minimum-wage 
hike and a strong rebound in tourism will likely support economic activity over the summer. 
However, a limited GDP contraction is in the cards in 4Q22 due to slower global growth 
and energy costs weighing more on household disposable income in the winter.  

■ Despite support from fiscal policies and potentially another sizable minimum-wage hike, we 

expect GDP growth to ease to 3.3% next year, reflecting slower growth in external 
demand. Domestic lending conditions will likely tighten in 2H23, if orthodox policies resume 
to fight inflation and curb macroeconomic imbalances. 

■ Inflation is on its way toward reaching triple digits in 4Q22, with energy and food prices 

continuing to drive the rise. The latter is unlikely to display the usual seasonality over the 
summer due to high demand from a recovery in tourism and pass-through effects from 
global food prices. Another sizable minimum-wage hike at the beginning of 2023, along 
with other populist policies ahead of elections will likely limit what would otherwise be a 
significant disinflationary base effect from December onward. We expect inflation to ease 
from 84% at the end of this year to 43% at the end of 2023.        

■  Rate hikes continue to remain off the table. Recently, authorities have opted for selective 

tightening of lending via macroprudential measures, thereby increasing the TRY-
denominated fixed-rate bond requirement as collateral for banks to help mitigate the 
treasury’s borrowing costs. Moreover, policymakers continued to implement measures 
aimed at getting companies convert FX holdings to TRY. The CBRT has changed the 
utilization conditions for export rediscount loans. The maturity of these loans has been 
increased, but exporters taking out these loans are required to sell 30% of their FX-
denominated export receipts to a commercial bank on top of the 40% they are obliged to 
sell to the CBRT. More recently, the banking regulator has restricted TRY-denominated 
lending to companies whose FX holdings exceed a certain threshold.  

■ The private sector’s net FX position has improved since 2018, while the FX risk has shifted 

to the public sector’s balance sheet. The aforementioned measures taken by the 
authorities might stall improvement in the former.

■ We forecast GDP growth of 3.4% this year and 0.6% next year. The statistical carryover 

effect accounts for 2.8pp of GDP growth this year. Monthly GDP fell by 0.3% mom in April 
after a decline of 0.1% mom in March and zero growth in February. We forecast output to 
fall by 0.2% qoq in 2Q22, driven by the substantial squeeze in real disposable income, a 
one-off effect from the fall in health output (due to the ending of free COVID-19 testing in 
England from April), and the temporary effect from the extra bank holiday in June to 
celebrate the Queen’s Jubilee. The risks are skewed to the downside. With inflation set to 
remain above 9% through the rest of this year, the squeeze in real incomes is set to be 
long-lasting. Consumer confidence hit a new record low in June. Business surveys have 
held up better, with the flash composite PMI unchanged at 53.1 in June, but indices of 
future output have declined sharply. We expect quarterly growth to be flat on average 
between 2Q22 and 1Q23, with a high risk of a technical recession. 

■ Headline CPI inflation ticked up by 0.1pp to 9.1% yoy in May, while core inflation eased by 

0.3pp to 5.9% yoy. Inflation is set to stay higher for longer in the UK compared to peers, 
largely reflecting the six-month lag with which energy regulator Ofgem updates its price 
cap in response to changes in wholesale prices. The next update is in October, and prices 
could rise by 40% depending on how the national statistics office decides to treat 
government energy grants. We see inflation declining rapidly in 2023, to 1.4% yoy in 4Q23, 
reflecting negative base effects, weak growth, rising unemployment and our (downward-
sloping) forecast for oil prices and futures curves for other commodities. We have assumed 
some gradual improvement in supply bottlenecks but mostly not until later next year. 

■ The BoE’s MPC raised the bank rate by 25bp, to 1.25%, on 16 June. Three of nine MPC 

members dissented, preferring a 50bp hike. The MPC adopted looser guidance on future 
rate hikes, simply stating, “The MPC will take the actions necessary to return inflation to 
the 2% target sustainably in the medium term.” This compares to guidance from May, 
when it said most members judged “some degree” of further tightening “might still” be 
appropriate in the coming months. In May, the MPC projected that inflation would fall well 
below the 2% target at the three-year horizon, conditioned on a market-implied path for the 
bank rate that rose to about 2.5% in a year’s time, around 80bp lower than current market 
expectations. The constant-rate projection had inflation falling to a little above 2% in three 
years’ time. This was a signal that some further tightening was probably warranted but not 
much more. We expect the MPC to hike just once more, at its next meeting on 4 August. It 
seems the MPC wants to see that a margin of spare capacity in the labor market opens 
before it stops rate hikes, and we expect this to happen after the summer.

■ We have lowered to 2.7% (from 3.0%) our GDP growth forecast for this year but confirm our 

projection for 2023 (2.2%). The downward revision to the near-term GDP path largely reflects 
disruptions in global value chains, a worsening of delivery problems and tighter financial 
conditions led by expectations of a more aggressive Riksbank (RB) tightening cycle. While for 
Sweden the risk of a recession is not particularly high, increased uncertainty related to the 
availability of and the access to oil and gas surrounds GDP growth after the summer.     

■ Economic activity is starting to soften amid substantial tightening of financial conditions, 

particularly in the housing market, which peaked in March. Notwithstanding lower purchasing 
power due to inflation and higher interest rates, household consumption is likely to continue to 
expand thanks to savings accumulated during the pandemic and to a strongly supportive labor 
market. Also, investment growth is set to continue, albeit weakened by supply constraints and 
tightening credit conditions. Exports are on track for a recovery thanks to healthy profitability 
and competitiveness of Swedish exporting firms. 

■ Recent inflation surprises, higher inflation expectations, a further rise in gasoline prices and our 

oil-price assumptions led us to revise upwards our inflation forecasts for both 2022 and 2023. 
We now expect inflation to peak at 7.1% yoy in 3Q22. Headline inflation is set to stay well 
above 2% through the middle of next year, to then fall to around 2% in 3Q23. Core inflation will 
probably hover around 5% until 4Q22, before starting to decline significantly over the course of 
next year. Second-round effects will likely be small. There is little evidence of wage pressure 
for now. However, on the back of a high-inflation scenario, the risk of price increases as a 
result of higher wages is rising. 

■ The RB started its tightening cycle in April, raising its policy rate to 0.25%, after it said in 

February that it would not need to raise rates until 2024. Although a U-turn in monetary policy 
was ultimately expected, the April hike came quite as a surprise, as it was not flagged by the 
Riksbank at the previous meeting in February. Following the upward revision of our inflation 
projections, and in the wake of further hawkish announcements from the Fed and the ECB 
recently, we expect the Riksbank to deliver a 50bp hike in both June and September and to 
deliver a final hike of 25bp in November, as the bank will probably want to see a clear decline 
in CPIF inflation readings before adopting a wait-and-see stance. We expect the policy rate to 
peak at 1.50% this year. The last time the policy rate was at such a level was in September 
2012.

■ We confirm our mainland GDP forecast for this year at 3.5%, while our projection for 2023 

has been lowered to 1.9% (from 2.2%). Overall GDP growth is expected to follow the same 
pattern: our forecast for 2022 has been confirmed at 2.9%, and that for 2023 has declined 
to 1.7% (from 2.0%). The downward revision to next year’s numbers is largely due to 
tighter financial conditions as we now expect a higher peak for the policy rate.     

■ The Norwegian economy recovered rapidly from the Omicron wave of COVID-19. As 

signaled by the Regional Network survey, activity rose through spring, but GDP growth is 
expected to slow in 2H22. Higher inflation and rising interest rates are likely to reduce 
growth in household consumption. At the same time, solid growth in petroleum investment 
and business investment is expected to support economic activity. 

■ Rising energy and food prices, higher oil forecasts and longer-than-expected supply 

constraints have led us to revise upwards our forecast for consumer-price inflation for this 
year and next. We now expect inflation to peak higher and later, at 6.6% yoy in 3Q22. 
While headline inflation is set to stay well above 2% through the middle of next year, 
inflation will likely fall below the 2% target at the end of 2Q23, with core inflation prints 
following suit. As longer-run measures of inflation expectations have risen and are now 
above 2%, we assume that there are some risks of second-round effects from wages. A 
tight labor market is likely to favor faster wage growth, and wage expectations are high, as 
signaled by the Regional Network survey.  

■ In June, the Norges Bank (NB) continued with its rate-hike plan, raising its policy rate by 

50bp to 1.25%. The bank also stated that it expects to increase further its policy rate, to 
1.50% in August, and it lifted its new rate-path projections, with the policy rate expected to 
rise to 3% by the summer of 2023. This is significantly above the neutral policy rate, which 
the NB estimates to be around 1.70%. Beyond the 25bp rise in August, we expect the NB 
to deliver another two hikes this year: one by 50bp in September and another by 25bp in 
November, lifting the interest rate to 2.25% at the end of 2022. After November, a wait-
and-see stance is likely to follow.

Chief German Economist

■ We forecast real GDP to rise by 2.4% in 2022 and 1.7% in 2023. Although Switzerland is 

far less dependent on Russian natural gas than many other European countries, 
uncertainties for the outlook remain high, especially for 2023. Only about 5% of 
Switzerland’s primary energy consumption is covered by Russian natural gas. However, 
the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, which account for about a quarter of Swiss 
exports, are also dependent on a steady supply of input goods from the German chemical 
sector. The smooth functioning of such supply chains could be at risk in the event of a 
Russian gas embargo (see also German country page).  

■ Higher energy prices, shrinking global trade and persistent supply shortages are likely to 

weigh further on economic activity in the second half of this year. At the same time, growth 
impulses might come from services and, in particular, from the tourism sector over the 
summer months, as a higher number of guests from other European countries are 
expected.  

■ Consumer price inflation is likely to peak in early summer at about 3¼% but inflationary 

pressure might remain high in the remainder of 2022. While a price-wage spiral still seems 
unlikely, signs of a further tightening of the labor market and higher wages in Switzerland 
are unmistakable. Recently, the unemployment rate declined to 2.2%, its lowest level in 
nearly 20 years. The number of job vacancies even hit roughly 100,000, a record high, in 
the first quarter of 2022.  

■ At its quarterly meeting in June, the SNB surprisingly hiked its depo rate by 50bp to  

-0.25%. Furthermore, and this was also unexpected, policymakers signaled their 
willingness to purchase Swiss francs on FX markets in order to dampen inflationary 
pressure through less pronounced rises in import prices. In the press conference, SNB 
Chairman Thomas Jordan pointed to the recent broadening of price increases across 
various goods and services. Given the latest hawkish rhetoric, we have changed our SNB 
call and now expect another 50bp hike at the next meeting in September, followed by 25bp 
increases in 4Q22, 1Q23 and 2Q23. This would lead to the depo rate peaking at 1.00%.  

■ The EU Commission wants to have a better understanding of Switzerland's position on 

bilateral relationship issues and therefore officially sent over a list of ten questions in May, 
which included the role of the European Court of Justice and agreements on market 
access. The Federal Council answered these questions and signaled its general 
willingness to make compromises and to proceed further.

■ We are revising our 2022 GDP growth forecast down to 4.0% from 4.7% previously and our 2023 

forecast to 4.2% from 4.7%. Lockdowns and restrictions of different kinds, including border 
controls and mass quarantine, in key cities like Shanghai and Shenzhen, have taken their toll on 
economic activity. Both retail sales and industrial production contracted sharply in April, with little 
signs of improvement in May. Even if most restrictions were lifted at the beginning of June, the 
supply side of the economy is recovering faster than the demand side as Chinese consumers 
continue their cautious behavior to avoid quarantines. We think economic activity in 2Q22 likely 
stagnated, while we left our quarterly path roughly unchanged for the rest of the forecasting 
horizon.  

■ Going forward, the course of the virus will also determine the course of the Chinese economy. 

According to current anti-pandemic rules, it is enough for a city to detect a handful of infections for 
it to enter a strict lockdown. Borders are sealed, mass testing begins, people are forced to stay at 
home, and schools and non-essential activities are shut down until local authorities announce that 
there are no more cases in the community. 

■ In the meantime, the central government is stepping up efforts to support the economy and reduce 

the negative impact of new waves of contagion on the domestic economy. Premier Li Keqiang 
recently warned of a “complicated and grave” employment situation in the country, with the 
unemployment rate moving above 6%, as in February 2020, when the pandemic started, and has 
asked local authorities to prioritize measures aimed at helping companies retain staff. Given the 
weakness in the recovery of private consumption, services activity is likely to remain subdued, 
prolonging the pressure on the job market.   

■ The State Council has also announced several measures to stimulate the economy, including tax 

cuts for the purchase of new vehicles, tax rebates for an increasing number of industries, relief 
measures for jobless people, and, in addition, infrastructure projects. Should the public health 
situation deteriorate in the coming months, the central government will likely take advantage of the 
fiscal space that it enjoys to shore up the economy either by tapping funds left over from last year 
or by issuing special purpose bonds.    

■ Thanks to the lack of CPI inflationary pressures and to a substantial drop in PPI inflation, the PBoC 

is also stimulating the economy, in particular supporting SMEs that have been hit more strongly by 
the lockdowns, through several lending facilities. In order to back a troubled real estate sector, it 
cut the five-year prime loan rate (a key reference for mortgage rates) to 4.45% from 4.6% and 
additional cuts are likely. The PBoC might briefly tolerate further weakening of the CNY towards 
7.00 against the USD to support exports.

■ We confirm our Brent forecast for 2022 of USD 114/bbl and for 2023 of USD 107/bbl. 

Given the elevated tightness of the oil market, which was exacerbated by the easing of 
lockdowns in China and the EU’s partial embargo of Russian oil, we see Brent prices 
averaging USD 125/bbl throughout 3Q22, with possible peaks at USD 130/bbl. Negative 
spillovers from lacking natural gas in Europe might support oil prices in the near term.  

■ The main reason for the lack of adequate supply is OPEC+, which is struggling to deliver 

on its formal production commitment. Many members of the cartel are already close to full 
capacity and Russian output is expected to keep declining at a fast pace – even if in the 
short-term Asian buyers such as India and China might take advantage of European 
sanctions, which will be phased in only gradually over the next six months. On top of this, 
there is no nuclear deal with Iran in sight that might free up some of the Iranian sanctioned 
oil, primarily because Teheran insists that the US must remove the Islamic Revolutionary 
Guard Corps from the US Foreign Terrorist Organization list. 

■ US producers are ramping up production, primarily through the activation of existing wells. 

US output rose by an estimated 520 kb/d mom in May, but it still remains more than 1mb/d 
below its pre-pandemic levels. Thanks to new investments, which are still less buoyant 
than one would expect given the elevated oil prices as a result of the shift towards 
renewable energy sources, production will return and surpass the 2019 output only in 
2023, providing relief to the oil market.  

■ On the demand front, the outlook remains highly uncertain given the current economic 

slowdown that is underway. The International Energy Agency expects global oil 
consumption to reach 101.6 mb/d in 2023, surpassing pre-pandemic levels. The main 
driver of growth will be China but new COVID-19 outbreaks might induce Beijing to adopt 
new tough restrictions that might weigh on consumption. In addition, a strong USD might 
erode the purchasing power of several emerging economies, affecting demand.  

■ We expect Brent prices to gradually decline in 2023 on the assumption that once the 

tapering of output cuts is completed by the end of the summer, OPEC+ will relax its quota 
system, allowing countries with more spare capacity such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE to 
pump more. In addition, Iranian oil might also reach the market simply through exemptions 
from Washington, even without a nuclear deal.
