2023 OUTLOOK

Dear Clients, 

To say 2022 was a tumultuous year is an understatement. 
 
Equity markets, which had peaked in January, dropped precipitously in less 
than two months as investors reacted to higher inflation and Russia’s invasion of 
Ukraine. Inflation in turn triggered the tightening of monetary policy. Central 
bank policy rates and interest rates across maturities rose at the fastest pace in 
decades, driving bond prices down by unprecedented amounts. Oil and natural 
gas prices gyrated as the Nord Stream 2 project was halted and other energy 
export sanctions were imposed on Russia. Financial markets were further roiled 
by growing global geopolitical tensions following the invasion of Ukraine but 
also aggressive posturing by China, including toward Taiwan. 
 
This year is likely to be less tumultuous for markets. Inflation is already 
trending lower. Central banks are expected to continue to tighten, but not to the 
extent seen in 2022. As a result, bonds will come under less pressure. Oil and 
natural gas prices are less likely to gyrate. 
 
Still, we face great uncertainty. The US Federal Reserve may overtighten 
monetary policy and create a recession in the United States. A recession in the 
world’s largest economy would reverberate globally. The US Congress may repeat 
the mistakes of 2011 in failing to raise the debt limit in a timely and orderly 
manner. China’s disorderly abandonment of its “zero-COVID” policy may 
unleash another wave of COVID-19 infections, including new variants, globally. 
The geopolitical outlook for 2023, too, is foggy and fraught with risk. There is 
no face-saving off-ramp for Russia from Ukraine. China is unlikely to reverse its 
assertive and aggressive posture. North Korea is expected to continue, even step 
up, its ballistic missile tests. Iran may proceed to enrich its uranium to weapons-
grade levels, which could elicit a military response by Israel. 
 
We proceed with caution.

 
We start with a careful review of the turmoil in financial markets last year 
because this backdrop is important in understanding the fog of uncertainty still 
facing investors.

Among financial assets, none were spared in 2022. US equities, as measured 
by the S&P 500, had a maximum drawdown of 25% and ended the year with 
a total return of -18% (in line with the bad case scenario, to which we had 
assigned a 15% probability in last year’s Outlook). The basket of FANGMANT 
stocks (Facebook/Meta, Apple, Netflix, Google/Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, 
Nvidia and Tesla), with a maximum aggregate drawdown of 44%, were among 
the worst-performing stocks in the S&P 500. Facebook/Meta and Tesla did 
particularly poorly, experiencing maximum drawdowns of over 70%. 
 
Outside the US, Russian equities had the largest drop, at 51%; China came 
next, at 45%; they were followed by Italy at 28% and Germany at 26%—all in 
local currency terms. 
 
Also in 2022, bonds, which typically hedge portfolios against equity 
drawdowns by rising in value, nose-dived in response to a steady stream of 
rising inflation and interest rate hikes in the advanced economies. The maximum 
drawdown in the price of 10-year US Treasuries was 22%. It seldom happens 
that 10-year Treasuries—which have half the volatility of US equities—drop 
nearly as much as these equities. 
 
The maximum drawdown of 10-year German bunds was 21%, and that of 
10-year UK gilts, 26%. This drop in the price of 10-year UK gilts stood in sharp 
contrast to the 5% total return of UK equities, as measured by the FTSE 100. 
The latter’s positive return was driven primarily by the energy sector and the 
metals and mining sector. 
 
Shorter-term bond benchmarks declined less but declined nonetheless: the 
maximum drop was 11% for 1- to 10- year US Treasuries, 12% for 1- to 10-year 
German bunds and 15% for UK gilts.
 
Oil and natural gas were thrown into turmoil with the invasion of Ukraine, 
and energy security has been thrust back into the forefront after a long hiatus. 
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices rose 62% between January and June 
2022, only to fall 42% to their subsequent trough in early December; for the 
year, WTI rose 7%. Similarly, Brent oil prices rose 59%, then fell 38%, ending 
the year up 10%. Natural gas prices were even more volatile, with the biggest 
moves seen in Europe, where prices shot up nearly fivefold by August before

descending as storage facilities filled 
up given a milder start to the winter 
season. For the year, prices were up 
8%. Prices in Europe are still over 
five times as high as those in the US, 
where natural gas prices were also 
volatile last year but much less so 
than in Europe. US natural gas prices 
increased by a cumulative 160% to 
peak in August before dropping, and 
now stand 20% above their levels at 
the start of 2022. 
 
Global economic growth surprised 
to the downside; our forecast of 
4.5% growth for 2022 made at the 
beginning of the year is now 3.0%, 
or 30% lower. US economic growth, 
forecast last year to be 3.9%, is now estimated to be 50% lower, at 2.0%. 
 
The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) reached a peak of 9.1% in June 2022. 
Core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, peaked at 6.6% in September 
2022. The US Federal Reserve’s preferred measure, the Personal Consumption 
Expenditures (PCE) price index, peaked at 7.0%, also in June, and the core PCE 
price index peaked at 5.4% in February. Eurozone and UK inflation rates likely 
peaked in October at 10.6% and 11.1%, respectively. We expect US inflation to 
decline to 3.7%, as measured by headline CPI, by the end of 2023. 
 
In 2022, central banks raised rates at one of the fastest paces on record to 
combat inflation. As shown in Exhibit 1, such a pace has not been seen in the 
US since the early 1980s, when the country faced inflation that peaked at nearly 
14.8% in March 1980. The pace has also never been seen in the history of 
the European Central Bank since its inception in 1998. Such a large and rapid 
increase in policy rates contributed to the turmoil in financial markets; we do not 
expect a repeat in 2023.

Clients’ portfolios experienced more volatility in 2022 than usual because 
equities and bonds declined at the same time in most markets. It is very rare to have 
equities and bonds drop over the same period in the US; since 1926, i.e., across 96 
years of data, a decline in both equities and bonds over a rolling 12-month window 
has occurred only 5% of the time when using a 10-year benchmark for bonds, 
and only 2% of the time when using a 1- to 10-year benchmark. 

60/40 Stock/Bond Model Portfolios 

Notwithstanding such rarity, reports issued last year by several financial 
institutions challenged the 60/40 stock/bond model portfolios. Some 
recommended adding real assets such as commodities, infrastructure and real

estate. Others recommended diversifying portfolios by allocating more assets 
to Asia ex-Japan. Still others recommended adding trading strategies, including 
hedge funds and momentum- and volatility-based strategies. 
 
The proliferation of such recommendations prompted some of our clients to 
ask whether they should reevaluate their strategic asset allocation accordingly. 
Our response is twofold.
 
First, appropriate, customized diversification for both institutional and private 
wealth clients has been a key pillar of the Investment Strategy Group’s (ISG’s) 
investment philosophy since its inception more than 20 years ago in 2001 (see 
Exhibit 2). Such diversification around a core holding of equities and bonds 
already includes asset classes and investment strategies that enhance risk/return 
to preserve and then maximize risk-adjusted wealth, especially at times of 
heightened uncertainty. 
 
Second, nearly a hundred years of data demonstrates that a mixture of stocks 
and bonds is an effective starting point for a portfolio, consistent with another 
pillar of ISG’s investment philosophy that history is a useful guide. The 60/40 
portfolio has generated positive returns on a rolling 12-month basis 80% of the 
time since 1926. 

Geopolitical Tumult

On the geopolitical front, the warning of the late Ash Carter, former US secretary 
of defense, was realized. We regularly consulted with him on geopolitical issues, 
and as was outlined in our 2022 Outlook: Piloting Through, he had asserted that 
the Russian threat to Ukraine was “the most dangerous, dire, and imminent of 
all the geopolitical risks.”1 So far, the Russia-Ukraine war has led to: 

• About 100,000 casualties on each side, according to General Mark Milley, 
chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff2 
• The exodus of 7.8 million Ukrainian refugees to other countries, particularly in 
Europe, and another 6.5 million displaced from their homes within Ukraine3 
6
Goldman Sachs
january 2023

• Over $100 billion in global military, financial and humanitarian aid to Ukraine 
(about half from the US), with at least another $45 billion expected in 20234

• A World Bank estimate of $525 billion−$630 billion of reconstruction in 
Ukraine as of December5 

The war has also led to further deterioration in US-China relations, especially 
when coupled with the joint China-Russia statement on February 4, 2022, that 
the “friendship between the two States has no limits.”6 The US and its allies have 
been changing their national security strategies toward China and imposing 
import and export controls on a wide variety of products. 
 
Turmoil in financial markets coupled with heightened geopolitical risks has 
raised the risks, though not the certainty, of a recession. Historically, rapid 
and extensive tightening by the Federal Reserve has led to recession in the US. 
Many economists expect it. Bill Dudley, who served as president and CEO 
of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, vice chair of the Federal Reserve 
Open Market Committee (FOMC) and Goldman Sachs partner, assigns a 70% 
probability to a US recession in 2023—one of the highest probability forecasts in 
the industry. 
 
At the other extreme, Jan Hatzius, currently Goldman Sachs’ chief economist 
and head of Global Investment Research, assigns a 35% probability to a US 
recession—one of the lowest in the industry. Incidentally, Dudley and Hatzius 
developed the Goldman Sachs Financial Conditions Index while they worked 
together at Goldman Sachs. The index measures the impact of Federal Reserve 
policy on the economy through the impact on the financial markets, specifically 
on short- and intermediate-maturity interest rates, equity markets, incremental 
yield of corporate bonds and the value of the trade-weighted dollar relative to 
other currencies. The wide difference between the forecasts of these two former 
colleagues is mirrored across the economic forecasting community. 
 
Notably, in his latest press conference, on December 14, 2022, Jerome H. 
Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, said “I don’t think anyone knows whether 
we’re going to have a recession or not … It’s just not knowable.”7

Outlook
Investment Strategy Group

 
Similarly, a week later, Lawrence H. Summers, Harvard University professor 
and former US Treasury secretary, wrote that “there is no basis for confident 
economic prediction. Some of the most stridently made arguments are also the 
silliest.”8 
 
When Chair Powell says that “it’s just not knowable,” we take heed; we assign 
a range of 45−55% to the probability of a US recession in 2023. To provide 
context: over the last decade, the highest probability we assigned to a recession 
was 30%. That was in our 2012 Outlook, after the European sovereign debt 
crisis; the next-highest probability was 20−25%, in our 2020 Outlook. 
 
Today, many leading indicators are pointing in opposite directions, and we 
believe it is important to convey this uncertainty to our clients unequivocally. 
In this uncertain environment, we believe portfolios should not be positioned 
for the certainty of recession nor for the certainty of modest economic growth. 
Instead, we recommend portfolios be positioned at their customized strategic 
asset allocation, where they are designed to ride out volatility and provide staying 
power in the event of geopolitical disruptions. 
 
If a recession is averted, financial market returns in 2023 will be less volatile 
than in 2022; we expect a moderate-risk diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds to 
provide a total return of 9.0% for taxable clients and 9.8% for tax-exempt clients. 
 
If a recession occurs early in the year, corporate earnings and equities will 
decline—possibly beyond the maximum drawdown of 2022—but bonds will 
hedge the portfolio by increasing in value, because the starting point of interest 
rates is much higher than it was at the beginning of 2022. However, by the end 
of 2023, as the recession recedes and the fog of uncertainty lifts, the equity 
market will most likely rally. We would expect high-single-digit returns for 
a moderate-risk diversified portfolio. If the recession lasts beyond year-end, 
the equity market will most likely end the year near the lows we saw in 2022, 
providing a total return of negative 4.4% from year-end 2022 and resulting in a 
low- to mid-single-digit negative return for a moderate-risk portfolio. 
 
Facing the fog of uncertainty in financial markets, economic growth and 
geopolitics, we will on our side:

• Watch diligently for hazards and, if appropriate, pull into a safe location and 
wait for the fog to clear. 
• Use our fog lights to search for tactical strategies that can take advantage of 
market volatility as opportunities present themselves. 

On our clients’ side, we recommend that you: 

• Avoid unnecessary lane changes; stay invested at your customized strategic 
asset allocation. 
• Allow extra time to reach your destination, as US equity markets will resume 
their historical upward trajectory.

In Section I, we provide the rationale for assigning a 45−55% probability to 
the risk of a US recession in 2023. We compare this tightening cycle to past 
tightening cycles and explain that although a recession is possible, it is not 
inevitable. We explain why staying invested in such an uncertain environment 
is our recommended course of action. In a March 2009 Sunday Night Insight 
titled Near-Term Pain, Long-Term Gain, we quoted the highly respected investor 
Seth Klarman of Baupost, who wrote: “To maintain a truly long-term view, 
investors must be willing to experience significant short-term losses; without 
the possibility of near-term pain, there can be no long-term gain. The ability 
to remain an investor (and not become a day-trader or a bystander) confers an 
almost unprecedented advantage in this environment.”9

 
Next, we spell out our one- and five-year expected returns and review our 
opportunistic tactical tilts coming into 2023. We currently have the lowest level 
of risk allocated to tactical tilts of the last decade. 
 
We conclude Section I with the key risks to our outlook beyond the recession 
risks, primarily focused on geopolitical flare-ups and possible new COVID-19 
waves originating from China.

other insights and recommendations are based on rigorous analysis of a wealth of

Assessing the Risk 
of a US Recession

we have assigned a probability range of 45–55% to 
the risk of a US recession in 2023. A midpoint of 50% and 
a 10-percentage-point range reflect the uncertainty of our 
forecast. A recession is not our base case, and our investment 
recommendations are based on this 45–55% probability. Since 
we at ISG started publishing recession probabilities, we have 
been quite unequivocal about our forecasts. As shown in 

SECTION I
13
Outlook
Investment Strategy Group

Exhibit 3, our probabilities have ranged from a low 
of 10% to a high of 30%. Our recession probability 
for 2022 was 10%. Since the global financial crisis 
(GFC), we have never forecast a recession, and 
except for the brief pandemic-induced recession, the 
US economy has not experienced one since then. 
When we have felt more uncertainty about our 
probabilities, we have used a five-percentage-point 
range, as we did in our 2019 and 2020 Outlook 
reports. A midpoint of 50% and a 10-percentage-
point range, therefore, is unusual for us. 
 
We have evaluated all our recession forecasting 
models, sought the input of best-in-class 
economists, and concluded that the tools and 
analyses that favor a recession in 2023 are as 
convincing as those that do not. We also have a 
wider probability range than usual because it has 
given us flexibility to adjust to incoming data. For 
example, favorable economic data such as declining 
inflation or declining job openings prompts us 
to lean toward the low end of our range, while 
less favorable data that points to an 
overheated economy and more aggressive 
Federal Reserve tightening prompts us to 
lean toward the high end of the range.
 
Despite finding ourselves in this 
difficult position, we are reassured by 
two observations.
 
First and foremost are Chair Powell’s 
comments, noted earlier, indicating that 

it is just not knowable at this point whether we 
will have a recession or not. He also mentioned 
that FOMC decisions will “depend on the totality 
of incoming data” and decisions will be made 
“meeting by meeting.”10 As the FOMC members 
react to incoming data, their responses will 
increase or decrease the risks of recession.
 
Second is Canadian-American economist John 
Kenneth Galbraith’s comment, “One of the greatest 
pieces of economic wisdom is to know what you 
do not know.”
 
We have also incorporated additional 
noneconomic risks into our recession forecast. 
They include a new wave of COVID-19 spreading 
around the world as a result of China’s reopening, 
heightened geopolitical risks emanating from 
Russia and debt ceiling negotiations in the US 
sometime in the second half of 2023. While each 
of these risks individually may not throw a well-
balanced economy into recession, two or more 
in conjunction with continued Federal Reserve 
tightening of monetary policy are likely to do so. 
We review those risks later in this report. 

Key Arguments in Favor of a  
US Recession 

The most compelling and most frequently cited 
rationale for predicting a recession in 2023 is 
the speed of tightening conducted by the Federal 
Reserve and the subsequent tightening of financial 
conditions. As the Federal Reserve tightens 
monetary policy by raising the federal funds rate 
and reducing the size of its balance sheet, financial 
conditions are tightened as:

• Interest rates rise across the Treasury yield curve.
• The incremental cost of borrowing across 
businesses and households increases.
• Equity markets decline, creating a negative 
wealth effect in which consumers reduce 
consumption as they become less wealthy.

• The dollar appreciates relative to other 
currencies, lowering exports as the cost of US 
goods rises for non-US-dollar importers. 

As we discussed in last year’s Outlook report, 
Piloting Through, not every Federal Reserve 
hiking cycle and subsequent tightening of financial 
conditions has resulted in a recession. Of 15 
hiking cycles in the post-WWII period, only nine, 
or 60% of the cycles, did so. The cycles that led 
to recessions can be differentiated from those that 
did not by some combination of the magnitude of 
tightening and the pace of tightening. 
 
As shown in Exhibit 4, the magnitude of policy 
tightening over the past 10 months has been the 
greatest and the pace has been the fastest on record 
since the stagflation of the 1970s and early 1980s. 
That period was marked by a ninefold increase in 
the price of oil from about $4 per barrel before the 
Arab oil embargo to about $40 per barrel after the 
Iranian Revolution and Iran-Iraq War. CPI reached 
14.8% in March 1980, and core CPI reached 13.6% 
in June of the same year.11 In the current cycle, CPI 
peaked at 9.1%; core CPI peaked at 6.6%. 
 
The tightening of financial conditions was 
equally severe in 2022. As shown in Exhibit 5, 
from its trough in November 2021, the Goldman 
Sachs US Financial Conditions Index increased by 
more than four percentage points. This was the 
biggest tightening in 11 months since the GFC. It 

was driven by the rapid increase in interest rates, 
the increase in the incremental yield (also known as 
the spread) in corporate bonds, the drop in equity 
prices and the large appreciation of the dollar. The 
best example of the impact of tighter financial 
conditions is the change in residential mortgage 
rates. Mortgages rates increased from 3.11% at 
the beginning of the year to a peak of 7.08% in 
late October, reflecting the combined impact of an 
increase in Treasury interest rates and an increase 
in spreads. Such high mortgage rates lowered 
homeownership affordability to levels below those 
of the GFC (see Exhibit 6). A decline in home 
prices, as measured by the Case-Shiller national 
home price index, followed, as shown in Exhibit 7. 
 
As we noted earlier, history is a useful guide. It 
shows that since WWII, such significant tightening 
in a short time has always led to a recession. 
History, however, is less helpful in telling us when 
a recession might unfold. The number of months 
from when a hiking cycle has begun to when a 
recession has begun has ranged from 11 to 43, 
with an average of 30 months and a median of 31. 
 
The tightening in this cycle started in March 
2022. Taking the historical experience at face 
value, that start date implies a recession could 
start as early as the first quarter of 2023 or as  
late as the fourth quarter of 2025. With such a 
wide range of potential recession start dates— 
and the fact that the historical average and median

would imply a recession does not begin until 
sometime later in 2024—we recommend clients 
stay invested. 
 
As we will discuss later in this section, our one- 
and five-year expected returns result in attractive 
portfolio returns. It is also not prudent to stay 
on the sidelines by being invested in cash for 30 
months or longer and risk forgoing those attractive 
portfolio returns. 
 
A model developed by Eric Engstrom and Steven 
Sharpe, two economists at the Board of Governors 
of the Federal Reserve System, referred to as the 
Engstrom-Sharpe model, supports the view that 
a recession is likely but not imminent. The model 
looks at the spread between the interest rate on a 
3-month Treasury bill in 18 months as priced by the 
Treasury market, and the current interest rate for a 
3-month Treasury bill. That model assigns a 70% 
probability to a recession unfolding in 12 months—
so a recession is likely in 2024. The model assigned 
a 1% probability in early 2022. 
 
Our ISG models also suggest a recession is 
likely. Our most reliable—but not foolproof—
model is the ISG Yield Curve Inversion Diffusion 
Index, which looks at four yield curves over daily, 
weekly and monthly frequencies. When the index 
has reached 100%, meaning all the yield curve 
inversions have been triggered, a recession has 
followed all nine times except in 1965 (see Exhibit 
8). This index triggered a recession signal when it 
reached 100% on July 25, 2022. 

 
Although this index has a reliable 89% hit ratio 
(percentage of time it has been successful), the time 
to recession after the index was triggered has been 
bimodal. As shown in Exhibit 9, the recession has 
typically started either about seven months or 1.5 
to two years after the trigger date. The likelihood 
of a recession within seven months of the trigger 
date, in this case by February 2023, is low. A more

likely scenario is a recession in 2024, according to 
this indicator. 
 
Another ISG model, the ISG Recession 
Scorecard, has not yet breached the elevated 
recession risk level of 65. As shown in Exhibit 10, 
the level stands at 62. The scorecard combines a 
series of leading indicators such as the Conference 
Board Leading Economic Index, the Institute 
for Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing 
Index of new orders minus inventories, and initial 
jobless claims, as well as a series of National 
Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) recession 
indicators such as the average of payroll and 
household employment and industrial production. 
In other words, this scorecard follows many of the 
indicators that have prompted most economists to 
forecast a recession. 
 
One important consideration when using such 
models is that no economic forecasting model has a 
perfect track record that can predict the occurrence 
and, more importantly, the timing of a recession. 
 
In a recent book titled Escape from Model 
Land: How Mathematical Models Can Lead Us 
Astray and What We Can Do About It, Erica 
Thompson, senior policy fellow at the London 
School of Economics Data Science Institute and a 
fellow of the London Mathematical Laboratory, 
warns that too great a reliance on models “can 
have catastrophic effects because it invariably 
results in an underestimation of uncertainties 

and exposure to greater-than-expected risk.”12 
She recommends incorporating some judgment 
into projections so that one can have “greater 
confidence that those projections will prove 
trustworthy.”
 
Hence, we examine other factors that, in our 
judgment, point to a lower likelihood of recession 
than that shown by the models.

Key Arguments Against a US Recession 

We now consider four factors suggesting the US 
economy may be able to avoid a recession: a 
balanced economy, a shorter lag of policy tightening, 
declining inflation and the possibility of fewer 
Federal Reserve hikes than are currently expected. 

Balanced Economy
The US economy is even more balanced today 
than it was at the end of 2021. A more balanced 
economy is likely to absorb shocks much better 
than an imbalanced economy. 
 
Exhibit 11 is a Financial Excess Monitor 
produced by our colleagues on the Goldman Sachs 
US Economics Research team. We have been using 
this tool since David Mericle, chief Goldman Sachs 
US economist, and the US Economics Research 
team created it in March 2018. It comprises 46 
different measures, such as the housing-price-
to-rent ratio, commercial real estate price index, 
credit card interest rates relative to the risk-
free rate, incremental yield of corporate bonds, 
equity market valuations, personal savings rate, 
corporate debt-to-GDP growth rate, leverage in the 
financial sector, and federal and state government 
debt. The monitor highlights pockets of risks 
in the US economy and financial markets. Red 
signifies excesses; blue signifies a well-balanced 
sector or metric. The monitor shows that all 
sectors improved in 2022 except for households/
consumers and housing, which showed a slight 

deterioration. In aggregate, the US economy is 
more balanced today than it was a year ago: the 
total line is a light shade of blue rather than white. 
 
Importantly, both the financial sector and the 
non-financial business sector improved—captured 
by the darker shades of blue. Some observers have 
expressed concern about the increase in debt levels 
in the non-financial corporate sector. As shown in 
Exhibit 12, non-financial corporate debt as a share 
of GDP stands at 49.7%, the highest it’s been since 
1980 except for the pandemic-related spike. While 
this level may appear alarming, it does not seem

so upon further examination. Most of the increase 
was driven by high-quality investment grade bond 
issuers that issued debt in order to take advantage 
of the low level of interest rates. The average 
coupon level of investment grade corporate debt 
is 3.7%, which is close to the lowest level since 
1973. The median level of the interest coverage 

ratio (the ratio of earnings before interest and 
tax payments to interest expense) for investment 
grade borrowers is at 7.0x, which is the highest 
since 1999. 
 
As shown in Exhibit 13, the cost of servicing 
the debt as a share of income is the lowest since 
1980, at 10.3%. Because most of the debt is fixed-
rate and generally of longer maturity, an increase 
in interest rates does not have a material impact on 
the cost of servicing the debt. An increase of two 
percentage points in interest rates raises the cost 
of servicing the debt to 14.7%, still very low by 
historical standards. 
 
We should note that while the level of 
imbalance in the households/consumer sector 
has deteriorated relative to the end of 2021, 
households still have significant excess savings, 
estimated at over $1.5 trillion. According to Bank 
of America data, households have savings and 
checking account balances that are still above 
pre-pandemic levels across all income cohorts, 
including lower-income and younger households.13

Shorter Lag of Policy Tightening
According to a Financial Conditions Index growth 
impulse model developed by Mericle and his 
team, the drag on GDP growth from tightening of 
financial conditions occurs sooner than is typically 
thought by most market participants.14 As a result, 
Mericle and his team estimate that the drag from

the tightening of financial conditions will abate in 
2023, as shown in Exhibit 14.

Declining Inflation 
Inflation has peaked and is declining across 
many drivers: 

• As shown in Exhibit 15, core goods inflation 
is expected to turn negative by the middle of 
2023, and the GS Supply Chain Congestion 
Scale has reached its lowest level since the start 
of the pandemic (see Exhibit 16). 
• With respect to shelter inflation, which is 
about 40% of core CPI, both the Case-Shiller 
national home price index and the alternative 
measures of rent inflation have been declining, 
as shown in Exhibits 7 (referenced earlier) 
and 17. Due to the mechanics of how housing 
inflation is calculated, the current decline 
impacts official shelter inflation with a lag 
of as long as a year. Since policymakers are 
aware of this mechanical delay, they are 
likely to incorporate these contemporaneous 
measures of shelter inflation into their decision-
making process. 
• Wages have been the most persistent source of 
inflation in 2022. However, we expect wage 
pressures to abate slowly as the number of 
job openings declines, the unemployment rate 
increases and lower headline inflation reduces 
the bargaining power for wage negotiations. 
Our colleagues in US Economics Research 
point to forward-looking indicators of wage 
growth such as monthly wage surveys and the 

Indeed Wage Tracker (for job postings)—shown 
in Exhibit 18—as support for diminishing wage 
pressures. 

Less Tightening Than Expected
Although our base case scenario includes the 
expectation that the Federal Reserve will raise

policy rates to 5−5.25%, we also recognize that 
there is a chance it will not raise rates as much as 
we expect. As shown in Exhibit 19, policy rates 
have typically peaked below the peak of where the 
market expects the yield on 1-year Treasury bills 
to be one year from now (1y1y). In the nine hiking 
cycles since 1972, there have been two exceptions: 

1974 and 1980. In all other cases, the Federal 
Reserve hiked rates to a peak below the peak 
market pricing of 1y1y. In this tightening cycle, 
the peak to date for the 1y1y was 4.7% in early 
November. It stood at 4.2% at year-end. If this 
historical pattern repeats itself, the Federal Reserve 
may hike only one more time. Given that most 
of the impact of tighter financial conditions has 
already occurred, as shown earlier in Exhibit 14, it 
is possible that a recession will be averted. 
 
Of course, there is a chance of further 
tightening beyond our expectations. Note in 
Exhibit 20 that the FOMC’s estimate for the 
federal funds rate in the December 2021 Summary 
of Economic Projections was materially below 
its most recent projections in December 2022. 
Even FOMC members do not have the proverbial 
crystal ball.
 
In summary, we think the probability of a 
recession in 2023 ranges from 45% to 55%. 
In Exhibit 21, we share the views of a panel of 
experts whom we have hosted on client calls; the 
lowest probability is from our colleagues on the 
GS US Economics Research team and the highest 
probability is from Bill Dudley. Jason Furman, 
professor of practice of economic policy jointly at 
Harvard Kennedy School and the Department of 
Economics at Harvard University and former chair 
of the Council of Economic Advisers, is at 55%, 
and Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s 
Analytics, is at 50%. 
 
We have also provided probabilities for 2024. 
By definition, expanding the horizon to two 
years to estimate the probability of recession 
increases the probability. As shown in Exhibit 
22, the cumulative probability of a recession if 
the economy is still in an expansion increases

from 12% in one year to 24% in two years, a 
12-percentage-point increase. Given the tightening 
of policy rates to date and the expected increases in 
2023, we believe the probability of recession will 
still be elevated in 2024, and we therefore expect 
the cumulative probability to rise by 20 percentage 
points from 2023 to 2024.
 
We now turn to our analysis of 60/40 
portfolios. We show why a stock/bond portfolio 
is still a compelling starting point and how 
diversifying the portfolio by adding certain asset 
classes and strategies provides the optimal strategic 
asset allocation. 

60/40 Stock/Bond Portfolios

Following the negative returns of both stocks and 
bonds in 2022, several institutions have questioned 
the viability of 60/40 stock/bond portfolios. We 
should note that the term “60/40 stock/
bond portfolio” is used generically by the 
financial industry to mean a portfolio of 
stocks and bonds; it does not imply that 
a 60/40 mix is the right allocation for 
every client.
 
The Financial Times reports that 
“private capital titans insist that the 
traditional 60/40 investor allocation 
between listed stocks and bonds has 
been rendered useless by central bank 

largesse correlating the entire market.”15 Some 
asset management firms have suggested rethinking 
traditional stock/bond portfolios or having a 
“makeover.” Quite a few firms warn of a lost 
decade for 60/40 portfolios. Most recommend 
adding asset classes such as commodities and hedge 
funds to hedge against the positive correlation 
between stocks and bonds seen in 2022. Others 
have recommended adding factor-based investment 
strategies and active equity managers to improve 
performance. 
 
This range of suggestions has prompted some 
clients to ask us whether they should change their 
strategic asset allocation. We do recommend clients 
reevaluate their strategic asset allocation on a 
regular basis, especially after a tumultuous year, to 
make sure that their portfolios are tailored to their 
risk tolerance, tax status and preferences. However, 
clients should not alter their strategic asset 
allocation simply in response to the noise around 
60/40 portfolios. 
 
Our reasoning is twofold:

• What transpired in 2022 in terms of negative 
returns for both bonds and stocks is a rare 
occurrence, and clients should not adjust 
portfolios solely because of a rare occurrence. 
We also find that positive correlations 
between stocks and bonds are common, and 
such correlations alone do not invalidate the 
value of 60/40 portfolios. There is no need 
to change asset allocation because of market 
performance in 2022. 
• ISG’s strategic asset allocation process uses a 
mix of stock/bond portfolios (60/40 or other 
mixes of stocks and bonds) as a launching 
pad. The 60/40 portfolio merely provides a 
reference benchmark: many asset classes are 
added to a client’s portfolio to improve the 
risk/return profile relative to a portfolio of only 
stocks and bonds. Of course, while we refer

What transpired in 2022 in terms 
of negative returns for both bonds 
and stocks is a rare occurrence, and 
clients should not adjust portfolios 
solely because of a rare occurrence.

to 60/40 portfolios generically, every reference 
benchmark and the corresponding diversified 
portfolio must be customized for each client. 

Frequency of Negative Returns in Stocks and Bonds
Negative returns in both stocks and bonds over 
any 12-month window have occurred only 2% of 
the time since 1926, as shown in Exhibit 23. We 
used the S&P 500 Index to represent stocks and the 
Bloomberg Barclays US intermediate 1- to 10-year 
Treasury index for bonds. About 67% of the time, 
both stocks and bonds provided positive returns; 
23% of the time, stocks had a negative return 
partially offset by positive bond returns; and 8% 
of the time, stocks had a positive return partially 
offset by negative bond returns. In aggregate, the 
data covers 96 years of 12-month windows. A 60/40 
portfolio produced a positive 12-month return 80% 
of the time, as shown in Exhibits 24 and 25. 
 
Another challenge put forth by the naysayers 
to the viability of 60/40 portfolios has been the 
recent positive correlation between stocks and 
bonds. The correlation between stocks and bonds 
has been positive since August 2022. As shown in 
Exhibit 26, this correlation has varied over time. 
We have looked at both three-year and 10-year 
rolling windows. While the long-term average for 
both series is 0.04, there have been periods such 
as the 25-year window between 1975 and 2000 in 
which the average of three-year rolling correlations 
has been positive at 0.33, and periods such as the 
22-year window between 2000 and 2022 when

the average correlation has been negative at -0.33. 
The correlations over 10-year rolling windows 
exhibit the same pattern of positive and negative 
correlations. 
 
The changing correlation between stocks and 
bonds, however, has no bearing on the viability of 
60/40 portfolios. 
 
Typically, investors expect bonds to provide 
some downside protection during large declines in 
equity prices. Bonds have done so even when the 
correlation between stocks and bonds has been 
positive. Exhibit 27 shows how bonds have had 
positive returns—albeit small returns at times—
during equity market downdrafts, in effect partly 
hedging the returns of the portfolio even when the 
correlations were positive.
 
We conclude that negative returns for stocks 
and bonds and positive correlations between them 

do not undermine the viability of 60/40 portfolios 
and should not deter clients from the use of stock/
bond benchmarks as a launching pad for strategic 
asset allocation. 

The Last Decade Does Not Imply a Lost Decade
A 60/40 portfolio comprising the S&P 500 and 
the Bloomberg Barclays Intermediate Treasury 
Index generated an annualized return of 8.0% on 
a nominal basis and 5.3% on a real basis (adjusted 
for inflation) over the decade ending in 2022. 
This compares to an annualized portfolio return 
of 8.8% in nominal terms and 5.4% in real terms 
since 1926. What differentiates the returns of the 
past decade is that they were produced with a 
low annualized volatility of 8.8%, compared to 
volatility of 10.1% since 1926. As a result, the 
Sharpe ratio (a measure of the excess return above

a risk-free rate per unit of risk) was particularly 
attractive.
 
We expect benchmark returns to be lower over 
the next five and 10 years. ISG’s Tactical Asset 
Allocation team expects, based on fundamental 
analysis, a 6.3% annualized total return for a 
60/40 portfolio over the next five years. The team 
does not provide 10-year portfolio forecasts. The 
Strategic Asset Allocation team expects, based 

on long-term returns driven by its multi-factor 
model, a 6.2% annualized total return over the 
next decade. 
 
Building a diversified portfolio based on the 
reference portfolio is expected to add another 
0.75 to 1.0 percentage point to returns, as we 
discuss below.

Diversified Model Portfolios Built Upon a 
Reference Portfolio of Stocks and Bonds
Appropriate diversification is another pillar of 
ISG’s investment philosophy. We recommend 
diversifying assets away from generic stocks and 
bonds into other assets, but only if those assets 
improve the risk/return profile of a portfolio. 
 
For example, one can improve the return and 
Sharpe ratio of a portfolio by adding high yield 
securities and illiquid assets such as private equity, 
real estate and infrastructure to it. We recommend 
a very limited allocation to hedge funds. As shown 
in Exhibit 28, diversification into these other assets 
is expected to add about 0.7 percentage point to 
annualized returns and improve the Sharpe ratio of 
an optimized portfolio from 0.43 to 0.51 relative 
to a 60/40 reference benchmark. 
 
We believe that one can add value to portfolios 
by introducing certain long-term investment 
themes. For example, US Preeminence has been 
an investment theme since the inception of ISG. 
We recommend overweighting US equities and 
meaningfully underweighting emerging market 
assets. In a December 2022 Insight on China titled 
Middle Kingdom: Middle Income, we restated our

view that diversified portfolios should overweight 
US assets and underweight emerging market assets 
and assets with significant exposure to China. In 
the interest of brevity, we refer you to that Insight 
for details. 
 
We also recommend avoiding certain asset 
classes that do not improve the risk/return profile 
of a portfolio. Among certain strategic asset 
allocation advisors, commodities—especially oil, 
natural gas and gold—have become a frequently 
recommended asset to add to a portfolio given the 
increase in inflation as well as the strong returns of 
the energy sector in 2022. 
 
We strongly advise against such a strategic 
allocation. As explained in our January 2010 
Insight report, Commodities: A Solution in 
Search of a Strategy, neither gold, nor oil, nor 
commodities in aggregate improve the risk/return 
profile of a portfolio. At the time, the prevailing 
recommendation was to add commodities to 
portfolios. We did not agree. As shown in Exhibit 
29, US equities have outperformed all key 
commodities since we published that report. We 
still do not recommend commodities, because 
they do not improve the risk/return profile of a 
portfolio and, notably, they are among the worst 
asset classes in outperforming inflation, as shown 
in Exhibit 30. 
 
It is important to note that we differentiate 
between strategic and tactical asset allocation. 

While we do not recommend commodities as part 
of a client’s strategic asset allocation, we have 
tactically allocated assets to commodities and 
commodity-related sectors and will continue to do 
so in the future.
 
US equities, in fact, are the most effective hedge 
against inflation relative to other asset classes. 
This asset class has had the highest frequency of

outperforming inflation over any period between 
one and 20 years, as shown in Exhibit 30. 
 
We conclude that a 60/40 portfolio is still a 
good starting point upon which to build a fully 
diversified portfolio. A year of negative returns in 
both asset classes, positive correlations and lower 
forward returns compared to returns in the prior 
decade do not negate the benefits of a portfolio 
that is composed primarily of stocks and bonds 
and has been supplemented by other asset classes. 
 
As Sir John Templeton, American-British 
investor, wrote, “the four most expensive words in 
the English language are ‘This time it’s different.’”16 
When market participants say this time is different 
and suggest that we are entering a new regime 
in which 60/40 stock/bond portfolios no longer 
work, we are reminded of Templeton’s comment 
and remain confident that history is a useful guide: 
this time is not that different from past periods of 
underperformance of stock/bond portfolios and 
positive correlations. 
 
Since we expect returns for the next one, five, 
and 10 years to be attractive, we recommend 
clients stay invested at a well-diversified strategic 
asset allocation that is in line with their risk 
tolerance. We now turn to our one- and five-year 
expected returns across publicly traded asset 
classes and make the case for staying invested 
despite the heavy fog ahead.

Our One- and Five-Year Expected 
Total Returns

Given the probability of 45−55% that we have 
assigned to a US recession, with a midpoint at 50%, 
we are also assigning a 50% probability to the base 
case scenario of our expected returns across the 
major publicly traded asset classes. We are assigning 
a higher probability to the downside scenarios, given 
the combined risks of recession and geopolitical 
flare-ups around the world. This is the lowest 
probability we have given our base case scenario 
and the highest probability we have given our 
downside scenario since the GFC (see Exhibit 31). 
 
Our expected returns are driven by our 
estimates of:

• Below-trend global growth of 2.4% in 2023, 
consisting of 1.2% growth in the US, mild 
recessions in the Eurozone and the UK, anemic 
growth in Brazil, below-trend growth in India 

and a recession in Russia because of the war 
in Ukraine. While our base case for China is a 
post-COVID economic recovery of 4.9%, the 
risks are tilted to the downside if the disorderly 
exit from COVID—which The Economist has 
referred to as “China’s COVID failure”—saps 
consumer and business confidence.
• Mid-single-digit earnings growth in the US; flat 
earnings in Japan; and declining earnings in the 
Eurozone, the UK and emerging markets.
• Slightly lower interest rates in the US, Europe and 
the UK; a modest increase in rates in Japan; and 
a very small decline in rates in emerging markets.

Exhibit 31: Base and Bear Case Probabilities for 
S&P 500 Year-End Price Scenarios in ISG Outlooks
Our base case probability for the S&P 500 is the lowest 
since the GFC while that of our bear case is the highest.

Outlook

• A negligible increase in the US dollar of 1−2%, 
and modest decreases in emerging market 
currencies.

As shown in Exhibit 32, we expect US and 
Eurozone equities to be the best-performing 
asset classes in 2023, with total returns in local 
currency of about 13% in our base case scenario. 
We expect returns of 12% for the MSCI All 
Country World Index. Such strong equity returns, 
if realized, will result in moderate-risk model 
portfolio returns of 9.0% for taxable clients and 
9.8% for tax-exempt clients. As mentioned earlier, 
we assign a probability of 50% to our base case 
scenario. 
 
We assign a probability of 30%, much higher 
than usual, to our downside scenario across all 
equity markets. However, in the US, the full-year 
returns in our downside scenario are relatively 
muted, at -4%, because US equities already 
declined 18% in 2022. Valuations declined from 
21.4x consensus earnings at the beginning of 2022 
to 17.4x by the end of the year. 
 
In our upside scenario, we expect equities to 
increase by as much as 27% due to lower inflation, 
above-trend growth in the US and higher multiples 
as investors are relieved that recession risks have 
abated. We assign a 20% probability to that case, 
as shown in Exhibit 33.
 
We estimate that our one- and five-year return 
expectations will be realized even if we have a mild 
US recession that ends this year. 

 
The most important question to address for 
clients is why we recommend they stay invested at 
their strategic asset allocation given the 45−55% 
probability of recession and 30% probability of 
our downside scenario.

First and foremost, while we have assigned a 
30% probability to a muted -4% return for the 
full year, we have assigned a 70% probability 
of S&P 500 returns of 13% or higher. The skew 
of expected returns by the end of 2023 is to the 
upside, based on our analysis. 
 
Second, ISG’s framework for underweighting 
equities in the face of a high probability of 
recession requires that equity markets have not 
declined more than 10%. As shown in Exhibit 
34, if the probability of recession is high—which 
it is currently—but the equity market has already 
declined significantly, it is too late to underweight 
equities; in fact, we look for opportunities 
to overweight equities, either directly or 
through options. 
 
Our framework to underweight equities in 
anticipation of a recession is based on post-WWII 
history showing equity markets do not typically 
discount recessions more than six months in 
advance. What transpired in 2022 was unusual on 
multiple fronts—not just because having a year 
with negative returns for both stocks and bonds 
has occurred only 2% of the time since 1926.  
 
Other rare occurrences also materialized last 
year. As mentioned earlier, our most historically 
reliable leading indicator for detecting a future 
recession, our Yield Curve Inversion Diffusion 
Index, triggered a recession signal on July 25, 2022. 
At that time, US equities had already declined 
17% from peak levels earlier in the year. Typically, 

equities have declined by low- to mid-single digits at 
the time of past signals, allowing time for defensive 
portfolio adjustments (see Exhibit 35). The largest 
decline prior to 2022 was 9%. So underweighting 
equities after a decline of 18% in 2022 is not 
prudent given our view that a recession is not a 
certainty and the fact that a significant market 
decline preceded the recession signal in this cycle. 
 
Similarly, the equity market has rallied after the 
start of every Federal Reserve tightening cycle that 
led to a recession. As shown in Exhibit 36, the S&P 
500 has rallied after the beginning of all tightening 
cycles by anywhere from 4% to 85%, with an 
average of 40% and a median of 34%. (We have 
included the tightening cycle that started in 2015, 
even though the pandemic triggered the following 
recession.) Therefore, the beginning of a tightening 
cycle is not reason enough to underweight equities. 
In 2022, the equity market had already declined 
10% by the time of the first hike by the Federal 
Reserve in March.
 
It is very unusual for financial conditions to 
tighten as much as they did in 2022 before the 
Federal Reserve raises rates.
 
The third reason we recommend clients stay 
invested at their strategic asset allocation is that 
portfolio returns after a year of negative returns—
such as we had in 2022—tend to be higher than 
long-term averages in the following 12 and 24 
months. We shared some of this analysis in defense 
of 60/40 portfolios. Here we examine the data for

moderate-risk portfolios that are benchmarked 
against 50/50 stock/bond portfolios because that 
benchmark is more commonly used by our clients. 
We note the following:

• As shown in Exhibit 37, negative returns for 
a moderate-risk portfolio occur only 18% of 
the time. 
• Typically, as shown in Exhibit 38, the market’s 
subsequent returns outperform long-term 
averages after a big decline. For example, in 
the post-WWII period, the total return of a 
50/50 portfolio was 10.6% in the 12 months 
following a negative return, compared to the 
average annual return of 8.9%. The returns are 
even more compelling over 24 months. 
• Of course, positive returns do not always 
follow 12 or 24 months later. During the Great 
Depression, a moderate-risk portfolio would 
have experienced a cumulative drawdown of 
53% for 2.8 years. A moderate-risk portfolio 
took 3.6 years to recover to prior peak levels, 
as shown in Exhibit 39. 
• In the post-WWII period, there have been three 
periods in which above-average returns have 
not followed a year of negative returns in a 
moderate-risk portfolio: the 1973−74 Arab-
Israeli War and Arab oil embargo, the dot-com 
bubble, and the GFC. We do not believe those 
periods are likely to be repeated: 

 
–  Monetary policy discipline was very different 
in the early 1970s, oil prices increased by 
nearly 2.5 times and inflation expectations 
became unanchored.

 
–  In the dot-com bubble period, equity valuations 
were significantly higher. The red diamonds 
in Exhibit 40 indicate valuations at the peak

–  During the GFC, aggregate leverage for 
households and non-financial corporations 
was 143% of GDP, as shown in Exhibit 42. 
It is now 123%, and the economy is very 
well balanced, as discussed earlier. Large, 
systematically important US banks have 

2.5x equity capital relative to risk-weighted 
assets compared to levels that existed 
during the GFC. 

As shown in Exhibit 43, the 12-month returns of 
a moderate-risk portfolio have averaged 13.3%

the three episodes that we think are highly unlikely 
to be repeated in this environment.

for exiting and then reentering the market must 
be excellent. For example, if a hypothetical New 
York City taxpayer sold equities at the beginning 
of 2022 and remained out of the market, the 
taxes paid on a dollar invested in 2009 would 
necessitate a market decline of 32% from the 
beginning of 2022 just to break even. Taxes paid 
on a dollar invested midway between 2009 and 
the pre-COVID market peak would require a 
market decline of 18% just to break even. 

Finally, our recommendation to stay invested is 
also driven by the general upward trend of US 
equities. As shown in Exhibit 46—an exhibit 
that is familiar to our long-standing clients—US 
equities are driven by earnings in the US economy, 
which are upward-trending except for recessions. 
Downdrafts pass and portfolios recover. On 
average, it has taken 10 months for moderate-risk 
portfolios to recover; the median time to recovery 
is eight months, as shown in Exhibit 47. We 
recommend staying invested because the risk of 
missing out on an increase in equities is far greater 
than a short-term mark-to-market risk that will 
eventually dissipate. 
 
We recommend clients stay invested at their 
full strategic asset allocation. We acknowledge that 
we made the same recommendation in our 2022 
Outlook report, Piloting Through. We believe 
that if our 2023 expected returns are realized, 

our recommendation to stay invested will have 
served our clients well. Interestingly, even if we had 
exited equities early in January 2022 and stayed 
in cash waiting for the fog of recession risk and 
other geopolitical risks to lift, our taxpaying clients 
might not have broken even. They would have paid 
more in taxes than they would have saved in the 
market decline. 
 
We now turn to our tactical tilts, which 
provided some incremental portfolio return to 
clients that used them in 2022, and review our tilts 
in place at the beginning of 2023. 

Our Tactical Tilts

A tumultuous year in financial and commodity 
markets presented the tactical asset allocation team 
with significant opportunities to add value to clients’ 
portfolios. Volatility was nearly double that of 
2021 as measured by the S&P 500, and about 80% 
higher as measured by the MSCI ACWI. At peak 
levels, we had 22 individual tactical tilts in 2022, 
compared to a long-term average of 10 tilts a year. 
 
Typically, these tactical tilts have been funded 
from fixed income assets and driven by attractive 
valuations and market dislocations. Volatile 
markets tend to provide more market dislocations, 
which, in turn, provide more opportunities for 
tactical asset allocation.

Offset Tax Consequences of Selling

We estimate that these tilts added about 50 
basis points to a taxable moderate-risk portfolio 
in 2022, outperforming intermediate Treasury 
and municipal bonds. The overall volatility of the 
tilts was 5.1%, and the beta to the S&P 500 was 
0.18. Despite the positive beta to the S&P 500—
which dropped about 18% for the year—the tilts 
produced a positive total return.  

S&P 500 Option Strategies: One of the most 
effective strategies in 2022 for taking advantage of 
increased volatility was using options to augment 
the returns of a fully invested portfolio.
 
The strategy is based on two tenets:

• Volatility tends to revert to its long-term 
average over time. If volatility spikes because 
of events such as the GFC, the pandemic or 
the Russian invasion of Ukraine, it eventually 
comes back toward its long-term average of 
about 20 as measured by the VIX. During the 
early months of the pandemic, for example, 
volatility reached 85. In 2022, it peaked at 39 
intraday and ended the year at 22, as shown 
in Exhibit 48. When volatility is high, options 
increase in value, and that may be an opportune 
time to sell options. When volatility is low, that 
may be an opportune time to buy options. 
• We tend to use options to enhance the risk/
return profile of a portfolio when we believe 
that buying or selling the underlying asset is 

a riskier strategy. For example, if volatility is 
high and we can collect an attractive premium 
by selling a put option, that may be more 
attractive than buying the asset outright. 
Sometimes, we use a combination of options,  
as we did in 2022. 

In 2022, we had a total of nine put and call option 
tactical tilts on the S&P 500. In aggregate, they 
produced a total return of 3.2% net of transaction

costs, with a volatility of 6%, compared to the 
total return of the S&P 500 of -18%, total return 
of intermediate Treasuries of -8% and total return 
of intermediate municipal bonds of -5%. 
 
While we do not have any such S&P 500 
options as a tactical tilt in early 2023, we expect 
this to be an effective tactical asset allocation 
strategy this year, as spikes in volatility are likely 
given the uncertainty ahead with respect to the US 
economy and geopolitical tensions.
 
As of year-end 2022, we had six tactical tilts, 
which is below our average number of tilts and is 
the lowest level of risk allocated to such tilts over 
the last decade. 

Overweight 2-Year Treasuries: We initiated a 
tactical tilt to a constant-maturity 2-year Treasury 
early in 2022. At the time, our view was that 2-year 
Treasury rates were already discounting Federal 
Reserve tightening to such an extent that the tilt was 
likely to provide a positive return. We still expect the 
tilt to provide a positive return, especially as 2-year 
Treasury rates ended 2022 at 4.4%. Given our view 
of economic growth at 1.2% and the federal funds 
rate peaking at 5−5.25%, we expect this tilt to 
provide a mid-single-digit return in 2023.18 

Overweight US Energy Infrastructure Master 
Limited Partnerships: The allocation to master 
limited partnerships (MLPs) has been one of our 
longest-standing tactical tilts. It was initiated 
as an option tilt in 2015 and changed to a long 
sector position in January 2016. This tilt has an 
inception-to-date return of 37% and has been one 
of our most volatile tilts. The MLP sector was up 
nearly 30% in 2022, compared to the S&P 500 
at -18%. While we have reduced the allocation 
to this tilt given its strong performance over the 
last two years, we still retain an allocation, for the 
following reasons:

• Valuations are still attractive even after such 
strong returns. Valuations as measured by 
the ratio of enterprise value to EBITDA are 
one standard deviation below their long-term 
average due to continued strong earnings (see 
Exhibit 49).
• Corporate management has continued to 
be disciplined about capital expenditures, 
with 2022 levels about 3.9% below 2021 
levels. 2023 levels are expected to be flat to 
slightly lower.

• The tax-advantaged distribution yield of 8% is 
attractive compared to fixed income and high 
yield rates. The companies in the Alerian MLP 
Infrastructure Index generate 1.8x free cash 
flow relative to distributions, so the distribution 
yield appears secure.
• We expect returns in the low 20s in 2023.

We note that we removed our S&P 500 energy 
sector tilt in October 2022 as the sector had rallied 
63%, following a 55% total return in 2021. The 
energy sector had outperformed the S&P 500 by 
83 percentage points when we removed the tilt. We 
removed the tilt because it had reached fair value 
on a normalized price-to-earnings basis, given oil 
prices in the futures market. 

Overweight Eurozone Banks: We have maintained 
our tactical tilt to Eurozone banks at a reduced 
allocation. This is also among our longest-standing 
tilts, initiated in June 2018. And very much like our 
MLP tilt, it has been very volatile. It outperformed 
the European markets in both 2021, with a total 
return of 42%, and 2022, with a total return of 2%. 
We retain this allocation for the following reasons:

• Rising rates will improve the banks’ net interest 
margins and overall profitability.
• We expect only a moderate rise in provisions 
despite our recession forecast for the Eurozone. 
Leverage has remained low, and two-thirds of 
the post-COVID increase in lending is covered

by government guarantees. There are currently 
no signs of deterioration in asset quality, as 
shown in Exhibit 50.
• The banks’ capital ratio is near record highs. 
• We expect a total return in the low 20s, 
composed of 6% dividend yield and multiple 
expansion as the price-to-book ratio increases 
from its current low level of 0.60x to 0.69x. 
As shown by the red triangle in Exhibit 51, 
that increase in price-to-book is a reasonable 
assumption. 

Allocation to US Natural Gas Calendar Spread: 
As noted earlier, both European and US natural 
gas prices gyrated following the halting of the 
Nord Stream 2 pipeline and the Russian invasion 
of Ukraine. Fears of winter shortages of natural 
gas led US March 2023 contracts to become 
very expensive relative to April and trade at a 
historically high premium of over $1 per million 
BTU (see Exhibit 52)—a spread that had been 
wider only 9% of the time. This spread has 
typically contracted to $0.5 or less 95% of the time 
as the winter ends. The base case expected return 
on this trade was in the mid- to high teens, and we 
are rapidly approaching those levels. 

Allocation to Physical Uranium: We initiated a 
small allocation to physical uranium in 2022. 
Nuclear energy is becoming an increasingly 
attractive source of electricity as countries seek 

reliable, carbon-free and secure sources of energy. 
Some view nuclear energy as a permanent solution 
and others as a transition source of energy 
away from hydrocarbons while waiting for the 
development of more renewable energy sources.
 
Nuclear energy has supplied about 20% of 
total annual US electricity since 1990. In 2020, 
nuclear energy supplied 69% of France’s electricity 
generation.

There has been a sharp decrease in uranium 
exploration activity and in production from 
existing mines. Since 2018, mined supply has been 
insufficient to meet annual reactor requirements 
(see Exhibit 53), and utilities have accessed 
inventories and extended the enrichment process to 
extract more yield per unit of raw uranium. 
 
As of December 31, 2022, the price for 
uranium was $48/lb. We estimate that prices need 
to reach $70 or higher to incentivize adequate 
future production. While we do not anticipate 
those levels in the near term, we think this tilt will 
have long-term attractive returns. 

Allocation to Systematic Strategies: We deploy 
three systematic strategies to provide uncorrelated 
sources of incremental return to a portfolio: 
Systematic Upside Improvement Tilt (SUIT); 
Systematic Downside Mitigation Tilt (SDMT); and 
Trend-Based Rotation (TBR). 
 
All three strategies were deployed at the 
beginning of 2022. We removed the first two 
strategies after high-single-digit returns but have 
left the TBR strategy as a tactical tilt for 2023. 
This strategy was introduced in 2021. The goal 
is to rotate among 10 asset classes: US and non-
US equity indices, gold, US corporate bonds, US 
Treasury bonds and US cash. The strategy is driven 
by the trend in each asset class, its volatility and 
the likelihood the trend will reverse course once 

it has become extended. The strategy is based on 
the momentum factor and is a diversified strategy 
for ISG’s more value-oriented tactical tilts. We 
generally expect the strategy to deliver a high-
single-digit return. 

Role of Growth Stocks in Driving Equity Returns: 
Our tactical tilts generally have had a value 
orientation. Since the inception of ISG, we have 
had only a handful of growth-oriented tactical tilts. 
In total, our tactical tilts have provided incremental 
return to the strategic asset allocation process. 
Avoiding growth-oriented sectors did not hamper 
our performance, or that of the S&P 500.
 
One of the questions clients most frequently ask 
us concerns the role of a limited basket of stocks 
like the FANGMANT stocks, or the technology 
or communication sector stocks, in driving equity 
returns since the GFC. When we share our view 
that the return of the S&P 500 has been broad-
based, clients are often surprised. As shown in 
Exhibit 54, the FANGMANT stocks represent 
20% of the weight in the S&P 500 Index, down 
from a peak of 29% in November 2021.
 
The most straightforward way to show that a 
handful of growth stocks with large weights in the 
S&P 500 have not driven the index returns is to 
compare these returns using market capitalization 
weights to those of an equal-weighted index 
of stocks, where value stocks like Exxon, with

a 1.4% weight, and Coca-Cola, with a 0.8% 
weight, are given the same weight as Apple Inc., 
which has a 6.0% weight, and Microsoft, which 
has a 5.6% weight in the market capitalization-
weighted index. 
 
We have analyzed the data through the end 
of 2021 and end of 2022. We present below the 
returns of the two benchmarks for four periods: 
since March 2000, the peak of the dot-com bubble; 
since the trough of the GFC; and over the last five 
and the last 10 years. We focus on the data ending 
in 2021 because these stocks did extremely poorly 
in 2022 and we do not want clients to discount the 
analysis because of that poor performance. Late 
2021 also marks the peak weight of the basket of 
FANGMANT stocks in the S&P 500 Index. This 
basket of stocks declined 40% in 2022. 
 
Since 2000 and since the trough of the GFC, 
the equal-weighted index outperformed the 
market capitalization index by 2.21 and 0.94 
percentage points, respectively, on an annualized 
basis. Over the decade ending in 2021, 
the market capitalization-weighted 
index outperformed by 0.92 percentage 
point. The outperformance increased 
to 2.75 percentage points over the five 
years ending in 2021, and that includes 
the strong outperformance during the 
pandemic (see Exhibit 55).
 
If the returns had been driven by a 
basket of growth-oriented stocks alone, 

the equal-weighted index would have lagged the 
market capitalization-weighted index significantly 
over all periods. 
 
An alternative approach is to look at the 
total return across all S&P 500 Index sectors. As 
shown in Exhibit 56, the information technology 
sector outperformed after the trough of the GFC. 
However, financials, industrials and health care all 
outperformed the broader market. 
 
While our US Preeminence theme is not 
reflected in a tactical asset allocation tilt, it is a 
strategic asset allocation overweight. As shown in 
Exhibits 57–72, the US is preeminent across most 
metrics that underpin economic growth, superior 
earnings growth and greater resilience. Should 
some of the risks other than recession that we 
have outlined in the next section materialize, this 
resilience will be paramount. Even so, these risks 
could derail our 2023 outlook.

Additional Risks to Our Outlook

We face significantly greater risks in 2023 than we 
did in 2022:
 
• In 2022, we assigned a 10% probability of 
recession in the US; we have increased that 
probability to 45−55% for 2023. 
• We wrote that the late Ash Carter, former 
US secretary of defense, had assigned a 50% 
probability to the risk of a Russian invasion 
of Ukraine in 2022. Now, not only has that 
happened, but we are facing risk of escalation, 
including attacks on infrastructure beyond 
Ukraine’s borders and a nonzero probability of 
tactical nuclear weapon deployment. 
• We wrote that US-China relations were going 
to be a source of uncertainty and volatility 
for the indefinite future; China became more 
aggressive in both its policy statements and its 
military activities in 2022. 
• With respect to North Korea, we wrote that 
we were least worried about rising tensions in 
2022, but now we are worried about Kim Jong 
Un’s more aggressive posture toward missile 
testing and North Korea’s nuclear capabilities. 
• We wrote about two risks with respect to 
Iran: continued development of its nuclear 
program and its extensive missile program. The 
risks are even greater now given Iran’s further 
enrichment of its uranium and its new military 
partnership with Russia.
• On COVID, we highlighted the risks of a more 
transmissible variant and risks to supply chains 
from China’s “zero-COVID” policy. The risks 
from COVID are unchanged. The new XBB.1.5 
omicron subvariant has become the dominant 
variant in parts of the US, and China’s disorderly 
abandonment of its “zero-COVID” policy may 
create another surge of infections in other parts 
of the world. 
• We did not cite US midterm elections as a risk 
in 2022. However, the US will be a source of 
volatility in the second half of 2023: US debt 
ceiling negotiations are likely to be contentious 
and lead to market volatility, as they have in 
the past. 

In aggregate, we think the risks to our economic and 
financial market outlook are greater than in 2022. 
 
We begin with the geopolitical risks, since the 
recession risks were discussed earlier. We have 

consulted on these risks with Andrew Bishop, 
senior partner and global head of policy research 
at Signum Global Advisors; Ian Bremmer, president 
and founder of Eurasia Group; General Sir Nick 
Carter, former chief of the Defence Staff in the UK; 
Bernie Haykel, professor of Near Eastern studies at 
Princeton University; and Sir Alex Younger, former 
chief of the Secret Intelligence Service in the UK 
and regional advisor at Goldman Sachs. 

Ukraine-Russia War
The base case for most of the geopolitical advisors 
we have consulted with is a war that will last well 
beyond 2023. There is no face-saving off-ramp 
for President Vladimir Putin, and Ukraine cannot 
readily come to the negotiating table after the war 
crimes committed by the Russians against men, 
women and children, and the extensive damage to 
civilian structures and infrastructure. 
 
The greatest risk is escalation by the Russians: 

• Russian could become more aggressive, 
targeting infrastructure such as undersea cables 
and pipelines outside Ukraine.
• Russia could launch cyberattacks globally.
• Russia, most importantly, could use its nuclear 
capabilities. 

 
–  Russia has the ability to use the ruse of a 
“dirty bomb” as a false flag somewhere 
near the Russian border to undermine 
Ukraine’s position, according to General Sir 
Nick Carter.19

 
–  It could use a small-scale tactical nuclear 
weapon with limited explosive yield in Ukraine.

 
–  It could use a nuclear weapon to generate 
a high-altitude electromagnetic pulse 
that would damage electronics and 
communication systems.

The geopolitical advisors we have consulted with expect the Ukraine-
Russia war to last well beyond 2023.

According to Bremmer, the US has told Russia 
that if it were to deploy a nuclear weapon, 
the US would directly target Russian forces.20 
Theoretically, that warning should be a sufficient 
deterrent to President Putin. However, Sir Alex 
warns that “we cannot rely on Putin to act 
rationally. He has a higher readiness to accept 
risk.”21 Bremmer has assigned a 5% probability to 
use of nuclear weapons. 
 
Financially, Russia can afford to prolong 
this war through 2023 and possibly through 
2024. We base this assessment on a series of 
assumptions, such as: 

• A modest GDP decline in Russia of 3% in 2022 
relative to high-single-digit drop expectations 
• Equally modest GDP decline of 2.6% in 2023 
• Oil and gas exports continuing at year-end 
2022 levels
• China and India continuing to import 24% and 
11%, respectively, of Russia’s export of crude 
oil and refined products 
• Russia’s ability to issue bonds domestically 
and tap oligarchs, their companies and the 
sovereign wealth fund, which has an 
estimated $186 billion in assets 

One factor constraining how long 
Russia can continue the war is its supply 
of artillery ammunition. Admiral Sir 
Tony Radakin has said that “Russia 
faces critical shortages of artillery 

munitions,”22 and US officials have made similar 
statements. The Wagner Group, a Russian 
mercenary company, has also complained about 
the lack of ammunition.23 Others have countered 
that Russia can tap into Soviet-era stockpiles and 
import ammunition from North Korea. 
 
Finally, a cutoff of the West’s military, financial 
and humanitarian support to Ukraine would 
increase the likelihood that Ukraine would be 
forced to negotiate a settlement of some kind. 
While some have questioned the resolve of the 
US and Europe, it appears that their resolve has 
only strengthened. Ukraine has received increasing 
funds, more sophisticated military equipment 
and stronger statements of support from most 
Western leaders. 
 
Europe is also under limited pressure to resume 
imports of natural gas from Russia. Germany, in 
less than a year from the start of construction, 
inaugurated its first floating liquefied natural gas 
(LNG) terminal in Wilhelmshaven, and accepted its 
first shipment of LNG from the US. The terminal 
can process close to 6% of Germany’s 2021 
consumption level. Coincidentally, the US is fast 
becoming the largest exporter of LNG, as shown 
in Exhibit 73. In 2022, it matched Qatar’s exports, 
and it is expected to exceed Qatar’s level once 
the Freeport export plant in Texas returns to full 
production after a June 2022 fire.

The Ukraine-Russia war is likely to continue, 
and risks of escalation will contribute to market 
volatility. 

US-China Tensions
As discussed extensively in our China Insight 
report, Middle Kingdom: Middle Income, China 
has become more aggressive and assertive in its 
foreign policy toward the West. The US and its 
allies have responded by changing their national 
security strategies; they have introduced export and 
import controls such as the US Bureau of Industry 
and Security’s revision of export controls of high-
end semiconductors and enhanced cybersecurity 
measures. Please see the report for a detailed 
discussion on this topic.
 
We think financial market volatility emanating 
from US-China tensions will ebb and flow. The 
meeting between Presidents Biden and Xi on 
November 14, 2022, in Bali, Indonesia, and the 
appointment of the Chinese ambassador to the US 
as foreign minister on December 30, 2022, have 
been interpreted as an improvement in US-China 
relations. On the other hand, a series of military 
activities in December 2022 have been interpreted 
as a more aggressive approach:

• The Japanese Ministry of Defense reported 
that between December 17 and December 
27, the Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning 
and its accompanying vessels sailed near the 
southernmost part of Japan and that there were 
numerous aircraft takeoffs that prompted Japan 
to scramble military aircraft and vessels.24 The 
Lianoning and its task force also proceeded 
to within 400 miles of the US territory of 
Guam during this period, and Chinese media 
highlighted that Guam would be a target in a 
conflict scenario.
• On December 21, the US Indo-Pacific 
Command reported that a People’s Liberation 
Army Navy fighter pilot “performed an unsafe 
maneuver during an intercept of a U.S. Air 
Force RC-135 aircraft … in international 
airspace … forcing the RC-135 to take evasive 
maneuvers to avoid a collision.”25

• On December 25, China sent 71 warplanes into 
the vicinity of Taiwan, of which 47 crossed into 
Taiwan’s southwest air defense identification 
zone, prompting Taiwan’s military to respond 
with aircraft and navy vessels. The level of such 
incursions doubled in 2022 relative to 2021.26 

While US-China tensions and increased risks 
of military accidents in the air and the seas 
may contribute to market volatility, our panel 
of geopolitical advisors believe that the risk of 
a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is low in 2023. 
Most think it is unlikely over the next five years.

assigns a 35% probability of a Chinese attack on 
Taiwan over the next two years. 

North Korea
While we were not worried about North Korea’s 
activities spilling into financial markets in 2022, 
we think North Korea poses greater risks in 2023. 
As shown in Exhibit 74, North Korea has launched 
more missiles in 2022 than in the prior five years 
combined. The missiles have varied from short-
range ballistic missiles to intercontinental ones. 
CIA Director William Burns has referred to it as 
“quite troubling,” and Bremmer has warned that 
“they’re going to test a nuke.”27

 
Eurasia Group has also written that “the 
chances of conflict on the Korean peninsula are at 
their highest level since at least 2017 with fewer 
guardrails in place to promote de-escalation.”28 

China and Russia would have been the countries to 
place some guardrails on North Korea, but given 
the Ukraine-Russia war and rising geopolitical 
tensions between the US and China, those 
guardrails have been removed. 
 
While risks of incidents between South Korea 
and North Korea are non-negligible in 2023, and 
missile tests could lead to interim volatility in 
the financial markets, the risk of serious military 
engagement with North Korea is low in the 
near term. 

Iran 
Iran poses two threats in 2023: producing weapons-
grade uranium and making other irreversible 
advances in its nuclear program and expanding its 
weapons sales to Russia from drones to missiles. 

Nuclear Concerns. According to data from 
the International Atomic Energy Agency and 
the analysis from the Institute for Science and 
International Security (ISIS), Iran already has 
highly enriched uranium (HEU) at 60% sufficient 
to be used for a nuclear weapon.29 However, ISIS 
thinks Iran may prefer to enrich its 60% HEU 
to 90%, which is considered weapons-grade and 
more suited to Iran’s nuclear weapons designs. 
 
General Sir Nick has suggested Iran will very 
likely have reinforced its view from observing 
the Ukraine war that there is merit is possessing 
a nuclear deterrent.30 Sir Alex suggests that Iran’s 
leaders will not weaponize because their progress 
on enrichment “gives them enough leverage.”31

 
Eurasia Group writes that Iran might decide 
to enrich to 90% when the Joint Comprehensive 
Plan of Action (JCPOA) restrictions on Iran’s 
development program of ballistic missiles designed 
to carry nuclear weapons expire in October 2023.32

Goldman Sachs

Headlines from Iran on its nuclear program 
and responses from Israel will be a source of 
volatility in 2023. 

Transferring Drones and Missiles to Russia. The 
new military relationship between Russia and 
Iran has been troubling to the West. Burns has 
said that “what’s beginning to emerge is at least 
the beginning of a full-fledged defense partnership 
between Russia and Iran, with the Iranians 
supplying drones to the Russians, which are 
killing Ukrainian civilians.”33 In a joint statement 
after a United Nations Security Council meeting, 
France, Germany and the UK warned Iran “against 
any further deliveries of weapons to Russia, in 
particular of any short-range ballistic missiles, 
which would constitute a serious escalation.”34

 
In our 2022 Outlook, we quoted Kenneth 
“Frank” McKenzie Jr., Marine general and 
commander of the US Central Command covering 
the Middle East and South Asia; he said that Iran 
had reached “overmatch” where its “strategic 
capacity is now enormous” and it has “the ability 
to overwhelm.” Its missiles “can strike effectively 
across the breadth and depth of the Middle East … 
with accuracy and volume.”35 The joint statement 
warned that transferring such missiles to Russia 
would constitute an escalation. Escalation would 
lead to market volatility. 

Cybersecurity
Cyberattacks remain a major threat from state and 
non-state actors, with the biggest threats emanating 
from China, Russia, Iran and North Korea. 
 
US intelligence and national security agencies 
assess China’s state-sponsored cyber activities as 
presenting one of the largest and most dynamic 
threats to US government and civilian networks. 

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence 
considers Russia a significant threat given its focus 
on critical infrastructure, including underwater 
cables and industrial control systems, in the US and 
in allies and partner countries.36 
 
Use of ransomware is on the rise as well and 
will continue increasing in 2023. Australia will 
lead a global ransomware task force starting in 
January 2023 to develop safeguards for advanced 
economies, but the benefits of such a task force will 
not be immediate. 

Terrorism
Our panel of experts believe that the risk of 
terrorism is unchanged from 2022. They cite the 
absence of charismatic leaders and the lack of 
command and control under which terror groups 
could operate from the Middle East, including in 
Afghanistan. With limited state sponsorship, terror 
groups cannot get adequate funding to organize 
and pull off major terrorist acts in the West. 
 
General Sir Nick has warned that there is a real 
possibility of terrorism being exported on the back 
of migration from Africa. The assessment of the 
Combating Terrorism Center at West Point is that 
the threat of terrorism from Africa and the Middle 
East is more local and cross-border within the 
region than global, with “Africa emerging as the 
world’s leading terrorism hotspot.”37

COVID-19
COVID-19 risks in advanced economies are 
unchanged from last year. A new omicron 
subvariant, XBB1.5, has become the dominant 
variant in the US Northeast and could be 
responsible for the current surge. However, holiday 
travel and the winter may also be contributing 
to the surge. This variant appeared in Singapore 
in the fall.
 
The new variant has been described as 
immune-evasive: the virus is less likely to be 
neutralized by antibodies from prior infection or 
vaccines. According to Dr. David Ho, professor 
of microbiology and immunology at Columbia 
University, the level of immune evasion is 
“alarming.”38 Our COVID-19 advisor, Dr. Luciana 
Borio, former director for medical and biodefense 
preparedness at the US National Security Council, 
believes that the new variant will cause many more 
infections, but that T cells from prior infections 
and vaccinations will limit serious disease and 
hospitalizations for most people.

Cyberattacks remain a major threat from state and non-state actors.
47
Outlook
Investment Strategy Group

 
China is going through its massive first wave of 
COVID since the initial controlled surge in Wuhan 
in 2020. According to reports in the Financial 
Times, Sun Yang, a deputy director at the Chinese 
Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 
estimated that about 250 million people—or 
18% of China’s population—were infected by 
COVID-19 in the first 20 days of December 2022.39

 
Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the 
Chinese CDC, has suggested China will face three 
waves: the present one, a second one following 
the travel of hundreds of millions of people for 
the Lunar New Year starting on January 21, 2023, 
and a third one from late February to mid-March 
when people return to work from the New Year 
holidays.40 The University of Washington’s Institute 
for Health Metrics and Evaluation has estimated 
that China could see as many as 1 million COVID-
related deaths.41

 
Dr. Borio believes that the focus on variants 
emerging from China’s abandonment of its “zero-
COVID” policy is understandable but not fully 
justified. While China’s removal of all COVID 
restrictions, including travel restrictions inside and 
outside China, may increase COVID infections 
outside China, we do not expect the risks to 
meaningfully affect the financial markets. 

US Debt Ceiling
David Mericle and Alec Phillips, our colleagues in 
Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research, have 
highlighted raising the debt ceiling in 2023 as a 
significant risk to equity and bond markets. The 
debt ceiling limits how much debt the Treasury 
can issue to fund the US government and meet its 
coupon and principal payment obligations. The US 
is expected to reach its debt limit by August 2023, 
but it may be as late as October. 

 
Mericle and Phillips suggest that the political 
and fiscal conditions this year will be similar to the 
conditions in 1995 and 2011, when the US had to 
raise the debt limit and the process was “extremely 
disruptive.”42 In both those periods, a sitting 
Democratic president faced a Republican House 
which had won the majority after the midterm 
election, and federal debt as a share of GDP had 
increased at a more rapid pace. The “debt limit 
standoffs” between Republicans and Democrats 
led to increased market volatility in both periods. 
Prices of Treasury securities with maturities around 
the date of the debt ceiling dropped, and worries 
about a default increased. 
 
Mericle and Phillips point out that the process 
to elect a speaker of the House provides some 
insight into how the debt ceiling negotiations may 
transpire. 
 
We conclude that there is no shortage of risks 
that could derail our economic and financial 
market outlook. 

China is going through its massive first wave of COVID since the initial 
controlled surge in Wuhan in 2020.

Key Takeaways

While we are facing a period of heightened uncertainty after a 
tumultuous 2022, we believe our two primary investment themes 
remain valid: US Preeminence and Staying Invested. US Preeminence 
leads us to overweight US assets in our strategic asset allocation. Staying 
Invested drives our recommendation that clients maintain their strategic 
asset allocation; that recommendation will change if we develop high 
conviction that a recession is imminent and not already discounted by 
the market. Currently, we do not have high conviction that a recession 
is imminent and one has already been partially discounted by the equity 
market decline. 

The key takeaways from our 2023 Outlook are as follows: 

• Below-Trend Growth: We expect global economic growth to slow to 
below-trend levels. We believe the US will have modest growth; the 
Eurozone, the UK and Russia will be in recession; and that Japan will be 
an exception with above-trend growth. Large emerging market countries 
will grow below trend at mid-single-digit growth levels, in our view. We 
estimate China’s post-COVID recovery will reach 4.9%, just above trend 
levels of 4−4.5%.

• Monetary Policy Tightening: We believe that most major central banks 
will continue tightening monetary policy but at a more modest pace than 
in 2022. China will be a key exception as the leadership tries to stem the 
declines in the property sector.

• Recession Risk in the US: We have assigned a 45−55% range to the risk 
of recession in 2023. We believe the fog of uncertainty is too great to have 
much conviction on the direction of the US economy, and we therefore 
recommend clients position their portfolios neither for the certainty 
49
Outlook
Investment Strategy Group

of recession nor for the 
certainty of modest growth 
in the US. The framework 
for staying invested is best 
captured by Exhibit 75. 
If the equity market has 
already largely discounted 
a recession, history has 
repeatedly shown that 
investors are better off 
staying the course given 
forward returns have 
typically been attractive.

• Attractive High-Single-
Digit Portfolio Returns: 
We expect high-single-digit 
returns on a well-diversified 
moderate-risk portfolio. 
The returns are driven by equity returns of over 10% in developed markets 
and 9% in emerging markets. We expect mid-single-digit returns in fixed 
income assets. 

• Significant Geopolitical Risks: We face a much longer litany of geopolitical 
risks this year, including an escalation of the Russia-Ukraine war, high US-
China tensions, more ballistic missile testing by North Korea, a growing 
partnership between Iran and Russia, continued nuclear enrichment in Iran 
and debt ceiling negotiations in the US. 

• Vigilance: In the face of fog, we diligently watch for hazards and will 
remain tactical to take advantage of market opportunities.

2023 Global 
Economic Outlook: 
A Difficult Balancing Act

SECTION I I

around the world, policymakers are attempting to cross 
a tightrope. For global central banks, the challenge is to lift 
interest rates high enough to dampen growth and bring down 
inflation, but not so high that they cause undue economic 
fallout. Similarly, governments are seeking to administer enough 
fiscal stimulus to help consumers cope with high prices but not 
so much that they stoke even worse inflation in the process. In 
both cases, leaning too far in either direction could be harmful.  
 
To be sure, the risk of a misstep is high. Global central 
banks collectively delivered more than 280 interest rate hikes 
last year in response to inflation that was both higher and more 
persistent than expected.43 Such forceful tightening of monetary 
policy clearly raises the risk of recession. At the same time, 
already stretched fiscal finances and fragile bond markets limit 
51
Outlook
Investment Strategy Group
52
Goldman Sachs
january 2023

the scope for additional fiscal stimulus, as the 
negative reaction of the UK gilt market to the 
government’s expansionary budget last year 
reminds us. Additional stimulus is particularly 
constrained today because countries representing 
almost three-quarters of the world’s GDP have 
annual budget deficits greater than 4%. Europe 
and the UK alone have deployed more than $750 
billion of fiscal stimulus to offset the impacts of the 
war in Ukraine.44

 
Still, a sure-footed crossing can’t be ruled 
out. We place even odds on the US avoiding a 
recession this year, as households still have a 
savings cushion, and the US economy lacks the 
obvious cyclical excesses seen on the eve of past 
economic downturns. In Japan, the economy should 
continue to expand at an above-trend pace given 
still-accommodative policy, as well as considerable 
excess savings. Meanwhile, emerging markets as a 
group are likely to grow slightly faster than they 
did in 2022 as they benefit from China’s uneven 
reopening. 
 
The Eurozone’s outlook, on the other hand, 
is shaky. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine put acute 
pressure on the region’s energy supplies and 
growth last year, likely causing a recession in the 
final months of 2022. The same could be said for 
the UK. But we expect relatively shallow recessions 
in both regions, as the economic slowdown thus 
far has been better than expected and a mild winter 
has helped cool energy prices. 
 
Taken together, these factors support our 
forecast for a year of below-trend yet still positive 
global GDP growth (see Exhibit 76).

United States:  
A Thorny Problem, Year Two

Inflation remains a thorn in the side of the US 
economy. As seen in Exhibit 77, headline CPI 
exceeded 9% at its apex last year, the highest level 
in four decades. That increase surpassed consensus 
forecasts by a wide margin for a second year in a 
row. But unlike 2021’s spike in goods prices, last 
year saw inflation expand to services as well (see 
Exhibit 78). 
 
While external factors like the war in Ukraine 
and ongoing supply disruptions from China’s 
“zero-COVID” policy have put upward pressure

Outlook
Investment Strategy Group

on prices, inflation has emanated from within the 
US economy as well. As seen in Exhibit 79, various 
measures of the underlying trend of inflation 
remain well above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. 
The same is true for wages, where demand for 
workers and a sluggish recovery in the labor force 
are stoking pay increases that are far outpacing 
productivity gains. As a result, there is much 

greater risk that wage gains are directly fueling 
inflation in shelter and other cyclically sensitive 
sectors (see Exhibits 80 and 81). 
 
Such persistently high inflation is a significant 
headwind to the US economy in at least three ways. 
First, it acts as a tax on consumers and erodes their 
real earnings. Second, it raises the hurdle for capital 
investment given a more uncertain future and higher

funding costs. Lastly, it is incompatible with the 
Federal Reserve’s price stability mandate, obliging 
the bank to tighten monetary policy to dampen 
demand. Taken together, these effects slow economic 
growth and raise the risk of a recession.  
 
These effects were clearly visible last year. 
As seen in Exhibit 82, real disposable personal 
income (DPI) was reduced by elevated inflation 
as well as the withdrawal of COVID stimulus 

payments and higher taxes. At the same time, 
financial conditions tightened substantially (see 
Exhibit 83) in response to the Federal Reserve’s 
steepest hiking cycle since the early 1980s. The 
war-driven spike in energy prices only exacerbated 
these economic drags, which collectively took 
expected 2022 US GDP growth from around 4% 
at the start of the year to less than 2% by year-end 
(see Exhibits 84 and 85).

Outlook
Investment Strategy Group

 
This abrupt economic slowdown comports 
with the Federal Reserve’s desire to bring inflation 
back to its target by engineering a period of 
below-trend growth. Our 2023 forecast of 1.2% 
real GDP growth—below the 1.5−2.0% estimates 
of trend growth—is consistent with that objective. 
We expect last year’s drop in net worth will 
dampen household spending (see Exhibit 86), as 
will a modest rise in unemployment. The same 
could be said for higher debt service payments, 
but still-healthy household balance sheets and the 
high proportion of fixed-rate debt are likely to 
keep those costs below their pre-pandemic levels 
(see Exhibit 87). Slower consumer spending is 
also expected to weigh on nonresidential business 
investment, while last year’s surge in mortgage 
rates should further reduce residential investment 
despite low homeowner vacancy rates (see 
Exhibit 88). 
 
Although inflation has likely peaked, the pace 
of its descent remains a key source of debate. 
Of the three component categories on which the 
Federal Reserve focuses—goods, housing and 
services other than housing—we expect goods to 
exert the largest drag on core inflation this year, 
given already visible progress and improvements in 
supply chain bottlenecks (see Exhibits 89 and 90). 
Housing will take longer to adjust given the slow 
rate at which the stock of rental leases turns over. 
Yet the Federal Reserve is aware of these lags and 

likely to look through them, especially since recent 
weakness in house prices and lease rates on new 
rentals imply a decline in housing inflation later 
this year (see Exhibit 91). 
 
The trajectory of the third and largest 
category—services other than housing, which 
represent more than half of the core PCE index—
is also the most uncertain. Wages represent the

largest costs in delivering these services, and the 
labor market remains tight, with about 1.7 job 
openings for every person looking for work (see 
Exhibit 92). We expect only a modest increase in 
the unemployment rate, from 3.7% to 4.1%; hence 
we also forecast a more measured decline in core 
PCE inflation, to 3.6% by year-end. This is still far 

enough above the Federal Reserve’s target to keep 
policy rates within 0.25% of 5% throughout 2023. 
 
Of course, the tighter monetary policy and 
below-trend growth necessary to bring inflation 
down also raise the risk of recession. That is 
particularly true today, given many of the most 
reliable long-leading recession indicators—

including our own Yield Curve Inversion Diffusion 
Index—have already triggered (see Exhibit 93). 
Moreover, most economists surveyed by Bloomberg 
expect a recession in 2023.45

 
We certainly acknowledge this risk and 
place elevated 45−55% odds on a recession 
this year. But there are several reasons that 
recession is not our base case. First, we estimate 
households have around $1.5 trillion in excess 
savings after the largest increase in their holdings 
of cash and cash equivalents on record (see 
Exhibit 94). Even households in the bottom of 
the income distribution—which tend to be the 
most economically vulnerable—are benefiting 
from disproportionately strong wage gains (see 
Exhibit 95) that have enabled them to amass a 
savings buffer. As recent Federal Reserve research 
highlights, these “households in the bottom half 
of the income distribution still held (as of mid-
2022) roughly $350 billion in excess savings—
about $5,500 per household on average,” which 
is sufficient to fully pay off  “their ‘liquid debt’ 
with room to spare.”46 Second, real DPI is set 
to rebound this year as many of the drags from 
2022—including higher gas prices, higher capital 
gains tax payments and lower transfer payments—
abate (see Exhibit 96). Our GIR colleagues forecast 
real DPI will rise a solid 3.5% in 2023. Finally, 
as noted earlier, we expect only a modest rise in 

unemployment, reflecting the still large number 
of job vacancies per unemployed worker. Without 
a strong negative feedback loop between job 
losses and reduced spending, it will be difficult 
for recession dynamics to take hold. However, 
recession risk may rise as we move through 2023, 
since these buffers are likely to erode over time.

As was the case in 2022, the interplays between 
inflation, Federal Reserve policy and economic 
growth will remain the key macroeconomic 
influences in the year ahead.

The Eurozone: About-Face

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine caused an abrupt 
decline in the Eurozone’s expected growth last year. 
Not only did the resulting surge in energy prices 
cause a sharp drop in real household disposable 
income (see Exhibit 97), but it also forced 
production cutbacks in energy-intensive industries, 
which hurt output. Although fiscal support helped 
to mitigate the economic impact of spiraling energy 
prices, central bank policy eroded that cushion 
as the ECB accelerated its hiking cycle to contain 
record-high inflation (see Exhibit 98). 
 
While the economy held up better than feared, 
we think the combination of these headwinds likely 
pushed the Eurozone into recession in the final 
months of 2022. We expect a relatively shallow 
economic contraction barring a colder than normal 
winter, with a peak-to-trough real GDP decline 
of about 0.8%, but the recovery is likely to be 
sluggish. Several headwinds—including weak 
external demand, elevated energy prices and tight 
financial conditions—are set to constrain growth 
in the second half of this year. The same can be 
said for fiscal policy, which is expected to flip to a 
slight drag this year as COVID-related programs 
expire. All told, we expect the Eurozone economy 
to contract by 0.3% in 2023. 
 
While this slowdown in economic activity—
along with the easing of supply constraints and 
some moderation in food and energy prices—will

Outlook

reduce pricing pressures, we see several reasons 
inflation is likely to remain above the ECB’s 2% 
target this year. First, last year’s spike in energy 
prices will lift 2023 goods and services inflation, 
given the typical lags. Second, euro weakness 
implies higher costs for imported products. Lastly, 
the still tight labor market increases the risk that 
higher wage growth will be sustained long enough 
to foster persistent services inflation (see Exhibit 
99). Against this backdrop, we expect headline 
and core inflation to rise by 7.0% and 4.2%, 
respectively, in 2023. 
 
In turn, we see the ECB hiking its policy rate 
to 3.5% and beginning quantitative tightening 
through passive runoff of its asset purchase 
program in the first half of 2023. Although we 
do not expect policy rates to remain at peak 
levels for an extended period given that 
supply disruptions are the main driver 
of the region’s inflation, we also think 
rate cuts are unlikely this year absent a 
significantly deeper recession. 
 
Clearly, the events of last year have 
revealed vulnerabilities in the Eurozone’s 
energy supply, which adds tremendous 
uncertainty to the economic outlook. The 
energy crisis could even resurface next 
winter if gas storage is not adequately 

replenished over the course of the summer and 
fall. Significant investment is needed to hasten the 
region’s energy transition, as failure to do so could 
leave the Eurozone economy permanently below its 
pre-COVID growth path (see Exhibit 100). 

United Kingdom: Mind the Gap

A cursory glance at the UK’s 4.4% growth last year 
would imply a booming economy. But the full year 
result belies a sharp deceleration in activity over 
the course of 2022 that culminated in a recession 
starting in the third quarter. While surging 
energy prices were a key driver of the slowdown, 
heightened policy uncertainty also had a material 
impact (see Exhibit 101).

Goldman Sachs
january 2023

 
We expect the downturn to be relatively shallow, 
with a 1.5% peak-to-trough decline in real GDP 
and a recovery beginning in the summer. But that 
recovery is likely to be feeble given the continued 
squeeze on household budgets from higher energy 
costs and elevated mortgage interest rates. Similarly, 
business confidence and fixed investment will 
remain fragile in the face of higher corporate taxes 
and tight financial conditions. As a result, we see the 
economy contracting 1% for the full year. 
 
Unfortunately, it will be difficult for 
policymakers to lend support. The limits of 
deficit spending came sharply into focus when 
the gilt market revolted in reaction to the Liz 
Truss government’s so-called mini-budget, which 
proposed large unfunded tax cuts to boost growth. 
To regain credibility with the financial markets, 
the Rishi Sunak government was forced to propose 
a new budget that was the exact opposite of its 
predecessor, featuring tax increases and spending 
cuts. In fact, this new plan is set to improve 
public finances by around 2.5% of GDP by 2027. 
Although many of these measures are backend-
loaded, they nonetheless leave less room for fiscal 
stimulus in 2023.
 
Monetary policy is equally constrained 
considering inflation stands at 40-year highs. 

Although price pressures are likely to moderate 
this year, several factors are apt to keep inflation 
well above the BOE’s 2% inflation target, including 
sustained wage pressures, the lagged pass-through 
from higher energy prices and the depreciation of 
sterling. As a result, the BOE will hike rates further 
into restrictive territory and continue reducing its 
balance sheet. We project rates reaching a terminal 
level of 4.5% in the first half of this year. 
 
More broadly, we think the medium-term 
economic outlook for the UK has weakened 
significantly. Aside from the current recession, the 
economy continues to face important structural 
challenges arising from Brexit and the need to put 
public finances on a sustainable path. These issues 
are not only aggravating the current economic 
backdrop, but also widening the gap between the 
UK’s current and pre-COVID growth path. As seen 
in Exhibit 102, that gap is set to widen from 5.1%

Outlook
Investment Strategy Group

1.5% last year, well above trend growth of 
around 0.8%.  
 
The outlook for 2023 is more nuanced. On 
the one hand, several factors support a further 
recovery, including households’ considerable 
excess savings, improved business sentiment, 
robust profit growth and the reopening of the 
economy to foreign tourists. On the other hand, 
new headwinds have arisen. As seen in Exhibit 
103, household sentiment has weakened amid 
declining real disposable incomes. At the same 
time, rising cost pressures and the weaker global 
economic outlook cast a cloud over firms’ capital 
spending plans. Yet despite these challenges, we 
anticipate the Japanese economy will expand 1.3% 
this year—its third consecutive year of above-
trend growth. 
 
It is tempting to blame this string of stronger 
economic reports for Japan’s surging headline 
inflation, which at 3.8% late last year stood 
near the highest level in three decades. But the 
rise in inflation has largely been driven 
by higher energy prices and the sharp 
depreciation of the yen. Wage pressures, 
in contrast, have been limited thus 
far. Given this mix of factors and the 
forthcoming government subsidies 
on electricity and gas, we expect both 
headline and core inflation to moderate 
this year, reaching 1.8% and 1.9%, 
respectively.  

 
With inflation expected to finish this year 
below the BOJ’s 2% target, markets were caught 
off guard by the timing of the bank’s hawkish 
decision to widen the band around its 10-year 
JGB target from ±25 bps to ±50 bps. Governor 
Haruhiko Kuroda had dismissed a wider band 
on several occasions, while research by BOJ staff 
found that a wider band could be detrimental 
to capital spending. Kuroda explained the move 
as a necessary technical adjustment to the yield 
curve control (YCC) policy that would improve 
bond market functioning and the transmission of 
monetary policy to the real economy. We interpret 
the move as a small first step toward normalizing 
the bank’s highly accommodative policy stance. 
Additional steps in that direction are likely this 
year, ultimately culminating in the removal of 
the YCC policy and possible exit from the bank’s 
negative interest rate policy (NIRP). Several factors 
will determine the timing of these steps, including 
the path of inflation, the outcome of the shunto 
wage negotiations in March-April, and the views 
of the yet-to-be-selected next governor who will 
succeed Kuroda in April. Even with these potential 
adjustments, however, the BOJ will remain among 
the most accommodative large central banks. 

Emerging Markets: Reversal of Fortune

Emerging market economies were hard hit by  
last year’s macroeconomic developments. Not  
only did Russia’s invasion of Ukraine result 
in surging food and energy prices, but it also 
tightened global financial conditions, significantly 
raising the cost of borrowing for these countries. 
The resulting slowdown in both domestic 
consumption and external demand was made 
worse by multiple COVID lockdowns in China, 
which further disrupted already fragile supply 
chains and hampered commodity demand from 
Chinese importers.

Although such an abrupt decline in economic 
activity would typically lead to supportive 
monetary policy, higher-than-expected inflation 
and the sharp depreciation of most EM currencies 
instead forced central banks to hike policy rates 
aggressively (see Exhibits 104 and 105). Fiscal 
policy provided some economic relief, but at the 

cost of further increases in already elevated public 
debt-to-GDP ratios. In sum, these crosscurrents led 
to EM GDP growth of 3.3% last year, well below 
the 4% trend and less than half the 6.8% pace 
registered in 2021 (see Exhibit 106).
 
Many of last year’s challenges are likely to 
persist in 2023. While food and energy prices are 
not expected to surge again this year, they remain 
well above pre-pandemic levels and will continue 
to weigh on household budgets. Lingering inflation 
also makes rate cuts by global central banks less 
likely, implying a continuation of tight financial 
conditions. On the external front, slower growth 
in major developed market countries will be a 
headwind to EM exports, while the reopening of 
China’s economy this year should benefit EMs 
more broadly. All things considered, we expect 
3.7% EM GDP growth in 2023, a modest pickup 
from last year but still below trend. 

Asia
Growth prospects in Asia look stronger than in 
other EM regions, but they hinge on China’s exit 
from its “zero-COVID” policy. Initially, growth 
is likely to slow in East Asian countries as the 
surge in China’s COVID cases dampens economic 
activity. But by the second quarter, we expect a 
pickup in exports to China as the initial infection

wave recedes. The region should also benefit from 
an influx of Chinese tourists as travel restrictions 
are lifted. Hong Kong is set to be a prime 
beneficiary, having been the main destination for 
Chinese tourists prior to the pandemic. 
 
But even here the outlook is not uniform. Slower 
growth in the US and Europe, along with a global 
shift from goods to services, will weigh on the 
recovery in both Korea and Taiwan. As a result, we 
expect GDP growth in these countries to slow to 
around 2% this year from closer to 3% in 2022. In 
contrast, India is expected to maintain a solid pace 
of growth at around 5.6%. In fact, India is among 
several countries in Asia that may benefit from the 
global relocation of supply chains over time.

China 
China spent much of last year enduring the 
deleterious effects of its “zero-COVID” policy, 
including frequent lockdowns and broad mobility 
restrictions in response to virus outbreaks. The 
result was a significant decline in economic 
activity, made worse by a slump in the property 
sector and various regulatory crackdowns on 
private industries. Although the government tried 
to cushion the blow with more infrastructure 
spending and rate cuts (see Exhibits 107 and 108), 
GDP growth nonetheless fell from more than 
8% in 2021 to an estimated 2.7% last year. That 
represents the slowest pace of growth since 1976—
outside of the initial pandemic shock in 2020—and 

one well below both initial consensus expectations 
of 5.2% and the government’s own growth target 
of around 5.5%.
 
China’s decision to begin easing COVID 
restrictions late last year in response to widespread 
lockdown protests will have a significant impact on 
2023’s growth outlook. As we have seen repeatedly

in other countries that relaxed COVID controls, 
there is almost certain to be an initial surge in 
infections. It took four months for the initial wave 
in Hong Kong to subside, while Singapore and 
Taiwan saw multiple smaller waves after the first 
surge (see Exhibit 109). China’s wave could be 
even more protracted than those in these countries, 
as its population has less natural immunity 
from prior infection and comparatively lower 
vaccination rates, and its vaccines are considered 
less effective. At the same time, China’s health-
care system is not well prepared to handle the 
surge in patients. Against this backdrop, we expect 
economic activity to remain subdued through the 
first quarter of this year, as people avoid public 
spaces and factories struggle to find enough healthy 
workers to run at full capacity. 
 
The economy should start to recover by 
the second quarter of this year as the virus 
wave recedes. We expect consumption to drive 
the rebound on the back of pent-up demand, 
considerable excess savings (see Exhibit 110) and 
an improving labor market. Fixed investment 
should also see a modest lift thanks to the pickup 
in consumer demand and continued policy support. 
But these tailwinds will likely be tempered by 
slower growth abroad, which will weigh on 
China’s exports and depress capital spending in 
the manufacturing sector. The property sector also 
remains an important risk to the outlook, but we 
believe it will be a smaller drag on GDP than it 

was last year, particularly given the government’s 
16-point support plan announced last November.
 
Overall, we expect the Chinese economy to 
expand by 4.9% in 2023. Despite the pickup in 
growth, inflation pressures should remain muted 
with headline and core inflation of 2.1% and 
1.1%, respectively, both well below the central 
bank’s tolerance level of 3%. For a more complete 
examination of our China views, please see our 
recently published Insight on China, Middle 
Kingdom: Middle Income. 

Central and Eastern Europe
Economies in Central and Eastern Europe have 
been severely impacted by the war in Ukraine, due 
to both their proximity to the conflict and their 
economic ties with Russia, especially through energy 
imports. These effects were visible in the region’s 
negative trade shock last year following sanctions 
and embargos on Russian energy, which precipitated 
surging inflation, widened current account deficits 
and depleted foreign currency reserves. Responding 
to these pressures, the regions’ central banks 
exacerbated the economic malaise by aggressively 
tightening monetary policy. In the case of Hungary, 
that amounted to more than a 10-percentage-point 
increase in the policy rate, while the Czech central 
bank eroded nearly a quarter of its FX reserves 
defending the nation’s currency. 
 
Although growth in the region already slowed 
sharply last year and current account balances are 
likely to improve in 2023, risks to the economic 
outlook remain high, especially if a cold winter 
intensifies gas shortages. Even with fiscal support 
measures, the region is likely to enter a recession 
early this year. While this should help bring down 
inflation, it is likely to remain far enough above 
central banks’ targets to limit the scope for rate cuts. 
 
Within the region, the outlook for Russia 
remains skewed to the downside. While its 
economy shrank by 3.0% last year—a smaller-
than-expected decline given the benefit from selling 
energy at high prices—we expect it to contract by 
an additional 2.6% in 2023. 

Latin America
Although Latin American growth was hurt by 
the broader global slowdown last year, several 
local drivers also affected activity. For example, 
the region’s central banks were among the first 
to tighten monetary policy in response to rising 
inflation in 2021, leading to a longer period of

tight financial conditions that has weighed on 
growth. Commodity price volatility has also had 
an impact, albeit a less uniform one. In the case 
of Colombia, Mexico and Brazil, higher oil prices 
provided a boost to growth, while in the case of 
Chile, disappointing Chinese copper demand was 
a significant drag. Growth in the region is likely 
to remain subdued in 2023, but the end of central 
bank tightening and China’s reopening may offer 
some reprieve later in the year.
 
Within the region, Brazil’s economy grew 
3.1% last year, led by a strong recovery in the 
services sector. Fiscal spending in the run-up to 
the presidential election and strong commodity 
prices also helped. But with its central bank having 
now taken real policy rates deeply into restrictive 
territory at nearly 8%, we expect economic growth 
to slow to just 0.9% this year. While the further 
fiscal support proposed by the new administration 
poses upside risk to this forecast, it would also 
delay much-needed debt reduction and therefore 
result in higher borrowing costs.

on the road to recovery from the global pandemic, 
financial markets hit an icy patch last year. The S&P 500 slid 
18%, its largest annual decline since 2008. The wreckage 
was not limited to US stocks. At the worst of the downdraft 
last October, 85% of the primary equity indices tracked by 
Bloomberg showed a loss for the year.47 Collectively, those 
declines amounted to nearly $32 trillion in market value at the 
time.48 Even bonds—which typically act as a defensive portfolio 
asset—were not spared, with the Bloomberg Global Aggregate 
Bond Index slipping 16%. This unusual decline in both stocks 
and bonds, which has occurred less than 2% of the time 
since 1926,49 resulted in the fourth-worst loss for a balanced 
portfolio on record.

To be sure, many of the key uncertainties from 
last year remain, including elevated inflation, 
ongoing geopolitical tensions, and the murky 
trajectory of the Chinese economy. The risk of a 
US recession is also top of mind, especially with 
central banks continuing to hike policy rates and 
many recession indicators already flashing red. 
These are legitimate concerns, and we accordingly 
give a US recession this year even odds. 
 
But we also should not lose sight of the fact 
that markets are forward-looking, meaning they 
typically fall in anticipation of bad news but begin 
recovering even as the headlines of the day remain 
ominous. This has two important implications 
for 2023. First, risk assets are likely to deliver 
attractive returns if a US recession is avoided, 
given the extent of last year’s losses. Second, even 
in the event of a mild US recession that ends this 
year, stocks could still deliver positive returns, 
considering the sizable rallies seen in the final 
months of past economic downturns. Since not all 
paths in a recession lead to stock market losses at 
the end of 2023, we believe the odds of positive 
US equity returns exceed those of a recession 
this year. This also explains why we expect gains 
in Eurozone and UK equities even though we 
believe these regions are already in recession (see 
Exhibit 111).
 
Our base case implies financial markets can 
regain traction in 2023. In equities, we see more 
paths to gains than losses by year-end. Bonds 
are also expected to rise, as today’s higher yields 
provide an ample cushion to absorb any further 
increase in interest rates. But there will no doubt be 
curves along the road ahead. 

US Equities: Down but Not Out  

Few investors will lament the passing of 2022. 
US equities lost nearly $13 trillion in market 
capitalization last year, roughly equivalent to the 
combined GDP of Japan, Germany and the UK. Last 
year’s rout was also the second equity bear market 
in the last three years. But unlike 2020, there was 
no speedy recovery last year. Instead, US equities 
spent nearly the entirety of the year mired in a 
double-digit drawdown that ranked among the most 
persistent downtrends in history (see Exhibit 112). 
 
The decline in stocks is understandable 
considering the bounty of concerns today. Recession 
is chief among these, as investors worry that the

combination of tighter monetary policy and below-
trend growth necessary to bring down inflation 
will also tip the US economy into contraction. 
That fear is reinforced by the cautionary signals 
emanating from a host of leading indicators, such 
as widespread yield curve inversions and the abrupt 
downturn in the housing market. There is also 
an unusual consensus among economists that a 
recession is likely (see Exhibit 113). 
 
Given this backdrop, our expectation for 
positive equity returns in 2023 may seem 
counterintuitive (see Exhibit 114). After all, how 
can we assign a combined 70% probability to 
favorable equity outcomes while also placing even 
odds to a recession this year? To understand, it is 
helpful to look at both the soft landing and hard 
landing scenarios. 
 
If recession is avoided, we expect mid-single-
digit nominal GDP growth to lift earnings by 
4–6% this year, providing support for higher 
equity prices. Exhibit 115 shows that earnings 
tend to track nominal GDP growth closely over 
time, as corporations are paid in nominal dollars. 
As a result, it is very rare for earnings to decline 
when the economy is still expanding—a fact that 
repeatedly confounded bearish calls for a collapse 
in earnings last year. 

 
Our expectations for a slower pace of US dollar 
appreciation in 2023 could also help ease some 
of last year’s pressure on corporate revenues. At 
the same time, we do not consider rising interest 
expense a key concern this year, as more than

90% of S&P 500 firms’ debt is fixed, its average 
duration is long (at about 12 years) and only 7% 
of it matures this year.50 Interest expense must also 
be netted against the interest income now being 
earned on nearly $2 trillion of cash on corporate 
balance sheets. 
 
We also draw comfort from the strong historical 
correlation between sales growth and profit margins. 
Past periods with positive sales growth—which we 
also expect this year—saw margins remain flat or 
expand about two-thirds of the time, even during 

the inflationary 1970s (see Exhibit 116). Moreover, 
the significant improvement in global supply chains 
in recent quarters should help ease the pressure on 
profit margins this year (see Exhibit 117). Consistent 
with this analysis, our base case assumes relatively 
flat margins. 
 
If the economy instead enters a recession, 
earnings will likely decline from their 2022 level. 
But whether that results in lower or higher stock 
prices at the end of 2023 depends critically on 
when the recession ends. As a rule, the market 
has more time to recover the earlier in the year a 
recession occurs. 
 
Two factors explain this dynamic. First, stocks 
are forward-looking, meaning they typically 
fall in anticipation of a deteriorating economic 
environment but begin recovering even as earnings 
are still being downgraded. During past bear 
markets, equities have typically troughed six to 
nine months before earnings reach their low (see 
Exhibit 118). Equities have also typically bottomed 
about three months before the end of recessions. 
Put simply, markets bottom when the news is 
still bad. 
 
Second, the recovery from past recessionary 
lows has been rapid, with the S&P 500 rallying 
about 20% over the span of a few months (see 
Exhibit 119). The combination of these two factors 
suggests that even a recession ending late this year 
would still be consistent with our base case S&P 

Exhibit 116: Percentage of Time Profit Margins 
Expanded When S&P 500 Sales Grew

500 target (see Exhibit 120). Because not all paths 
in a recession lead to lower equity prices at the end 
of this year, we believe the odds of positive equity 
returns exceed those of a recession in 2023. 
 
Other factors also support this conclusion. 
Once the market has fallen into bear-market 
territory—which happened last year around 
3800 on the S&P 500—the median equity gain 
in the following year was 23% (see Exhibit 121). 
Similarly, history suggests 83% odds of a gain in 
2023 given the rarity of two consecutive down 
years for the S&P 500. This year is also the third 
in the presidential cycle, which has historically had 
the highest returns of the four-year cycle and 84% 
odds of a gain (see Exhibit 122). 
 
It is also worth mentioning that past years 
that saw a similarly large decline in the S&P 500 
P/E ratio have typically been followed by strong 
equity returns (see Exhibit 123). While some have 
attributed last year’s P/E de-rating to higher real 
interest rates alone, we think it also reflects genuine 
recessionary concerns. That connection is apparent 
in Exhibit 124, which shows that real interest rates 
and Bloomberg stories about recession rose in 
tandem last year in response to the Federal Reserve’s 

aggressive rate hiking cycle. In fact, 2022 featured as 
many Bloomberg stories on recession as 2020, a year 
when the US economy was actually in recession.

To be clear, we are not arguing that today’s 
valuations fully discount a recession. But 
considering last year’s 25% peak-to-trough equity 
drawdown—which would be the largest in advance 
of a recession in history (see Exhibit 125)—we do 

think a significant part of any valuation reset has 
already occurred. Current US equity valuations 
also seem reasonable compared to past periods 
with similar interest rates (see Exhibits 126 
and 127).

Exhibit 128 summarizes the dilemma facing 
investors today. The favorable equity outcomes 
we discussed previously for year-end 2023 do not 
preclude lower prices during the year, especially 

in the event of a recession. But that risk must 
be weighed against the attractive returns that 
could follow a variety of soft and hard landing 
scenarios. Furthermore, it is difficult to imagine

that the market would be completely surprised by 
a recession at this point, which could temper the 
resulting downdraft. As seen in Exhibit 129, this is 
arguably the most widely anticipated recession in 
history and has already been preceded by one of 
the longest streaks of bearish investor sentiment on 
record (see Exhibit 130). 
 
Given the uncertainties above, investors should 
first ensure that their strategic asset allocation 
accurately reflects their risk tolerance. But provided 
that is the case, history suggests investors are 
better off staying the course and even looking for 
opportunities to overweight stocks if they weaken 
further, given the positive skew between upside and 
downside risks from current levels.

Non-US Developed Market Equities: A 
Rocky Road to Recovery

The relative performance of non-US developed 
equities was a bright spot last year. As seen in 
Exhibit 131, the 7% decline in the MSCI EAFE 
(Europe, Australasia, and the Far East) index in 
local currency terms significantly outperformed 
the declines seen in both US and emerging market 
stocks, which were closer to 20%. Some developed 
equity markets, such as the UK and Australia, even 
finished 2022 with gains. 

 
Although we expect more uniformly positive 
equity returns across EAFE countries in 2023, 
the path is unlikely to be smooth. This year 
likely begins with recessions in two of the largest 
developed equity markets outside the US, the 
Eurozone and the UK, which together represent 
around half of EAFE market capitalization. At 
the same time, ongoing geopolitical uncertainty in 
many countries likely sets a practical limit on how 
much of last year’s equity decline can be recouped. 
 
Despite these headwinds, we think forward-
looking investors will push valuation multiples 
higher this year as they anticipate an eventual 
recovery in earnings. For EAFE, that implies a 
low-double-digit total return in local currency 
terms. We also forecast positive gains for European 
markets this year, but we expect only the UK to 
recapture its previous peak. 

Eurozone Equities: Continued Resilience 

Eurozone equities bested their global peers last 
year (see Exhibit 131), a notable departure from 
their tendency to lag in down markets. This 
surprising outcome was rooted in a more than 
20% increase in earnings, which reached their 
highest level in more than a decade. Considering 
the Eurozone’s proximity to Ukraine and its

reliance on Russian energy, the resilience of its 
companies last year was remarkable. 
 
This resilience is likely to give way to lower 
earnings in 2023, as Europe begins the year in 
a recession amid a global growth slowdown. 
Even so, we expect investors to push P/E ratios 
higher as the region emerges from a short-lived 
and relatively shallow economic downturn this 
year, just as they have during prior recessions (see 
Exhibit 132). That view is supported by the area’s 
relatively attractive valuations. At just 11.3x, the 
Eurozone’s P/E ratio stands in the bottom 30% 
of the post-GFC distribution and below its pre-
pandemic value. The net result of falling earnings 
amid rising valuations should be a low-double-
digit total return for Eurozone equities this year; 
many elements of our forecast are the mirror image 
of their values last year (see Exhibit 133).
 
As discussed in Section I, we remain overweight 
the Eurozone banks. Not only did the sector 
outperform broader Eurozone equities 
once again last year, but it also generated 
a positive return despite a global bear 
market. Several factors underpin this 
resilience. First, the ongoing increase 
in global interest rates directly benefits 
the banks’ net interest income. Second, 
the banks have spent the last decade 
improving their balance sheets, resulting 
in higher capital ratios and fewer 

losses in their loan books. Finally, the sector is 
attractively valued, particularly relative to what 
investors have historically paid for the level of 
profitability it currently has. Against this backdrop, 
we continue to recommend an overweight to 
Eurozone banks given their improving profitability, 
scope for higher valuations and attractive 6% 
dividend yield. 

UK Equities: Still Playing Catchup

The gain in UK equities last year in local currency 
terms stood in sharp contrast to the significant 
losses seen in almost all other major equity 
markets. Last year was also the first time since 
2016 that UK equities had outpaced the MSCI 
World Index. This outperformance can be traced 
to a few factors, including the FTSE 100’s high 
concentration of value stocks and commodity-

exposed stocks, its record-low relative valuations 
at the start of 2022 and the depreciation of the 
currency. Yet despite last year’s strength, UK 
equities have still not closed the performance gap 
that emerged relative to other global equities after 
the start of the pandemic (see Exhibit 134). 
 
That gap is likely to extend into 2023, as UK 
earnings decline in response to a domestic recession 
and slowing global growth, as well as a waning 
tailwind from commodity prices and past sterling 
depreciation. But as was the case in the Eurozone, 
we expect investors’ willingness to pay higher 
valuations as the UK economy exits its recession 
to fully offset the decline in profits this year (see 
Exhibit 135). 

 
The combination of declining profits and a 
modestly higher P/E ratio—along with the FTSE 
100’s 3.9% dividend yield—supports a low-double-
digit total return in our base case (see Exhibit 111). 
The currently depressed levels of investor sentiment 
also imply similar total returns to our baseline 
forecast in 2023, as this has been a contrarian 
indicator of future equity returns in the past. 

Japanese Equities: Encore Unlikely

Japan also outperformed global equities last year. 
Three main factors drove this achievement. First, 
Japan’s overseas earnings benefited from the 
limited rise in the country’s interest rates and the 
sharp depreciation in its currency, both 
the result of the BOJ’s unwillingness to 
follow other central banks in tightening 
policy. Second, the Japanese economy 
was able to sustain above-trend growth. 
Lastly, the underweight position of foreign 
investors at the start of last year left little 
for them to sell (see Exhibit 136). Because 
these investors are typically the marginal 
buyers or sellers of Japanese equities, 
their underweight positioning indirectly 
supported the stocks.

111). As with our views on other EAFE markets, 
we expect higher valuations to be the key driver 
of equity prices this year, offsetting flat earnings 
growth. But we expect a smaller rise in Japan’s 
P/E ratio than in other markets, as the BOJ seems 
poised to tighten monetary policy just as other 
central banks reach the end of their hiking cycles. 
In fact, a more rapid or forceful tightening of 
monetary policy represents a key downside risk to 
our forecast. Given this balance of risks, an encore 
of last year’s outperformance is unlikely.

Emerging Market Equities:  
Fading Headwinds from the North 

Emerging market equities had another challenging 
year in 2022. Their 20% decline capped 
the sixth year of losses—and eighth year of 
underperformance relative to the S&P 500—in 
the last decade. While 16 of the 24 countries 
in the MSCI EM Index had negative returns in 
2022, North Asia was the largest headwind to the 
index’s performance (see Exhibit 137). Indeed, 
China, Korea and Taiwan—which together account 
for 58% of MSCI EM market capitalization—
collectively lost 25% last year, more than twice the 
11% decline for the rest of the index. 
 
We expect calmer winds from North Asia in 
2023. Not only will conditions look more favorable 
with China’s reopening, but the region should 

also benefit from abating declines in chip prices, 
less regulatory pressure on China’s internet sector 
and less of a drag on profit margins from spiraling 
commodities prices. As a result, we expect MSCI 
EM forward earnings to rise by 10% in 2023, to 
$90 per share. At the same time, valuation multiples 
should decline modestly to 11.4x, as slightly lower 
interest rates are offset by a moderate increase in the 
equity risk premium. Combined with EM equities’ 
3% dividend yield, these elements imply a high-
single-digit total return in 2023 (see Exhibit 111).
 
Despite these projected equity gains, we still 
see four dark clouds on the horizon. First, the 
outlook for China remains foggy given its rising 
economic, social and geopolitical risks, discussed 
in greater detail in our December 2022 Insight 
report, Middle Kingdom: Middle Income. Second, 
slower global growth will weigh heavily on 
export-dependent North Asia. Third, outflows 
from global investors could gain speed due to EM 
equities’ continued underperformance. Finally, 
tightening in monetary policy last year—which 
saw the median policy rate among the 17 countries 
in the MSCI EM Index with inflation-targeting 
central banks increase from 3% to 7%51 after 
101 collective rate hikes—was dramatic, and its 
ultimate impact remains highly uncertain. 
 
Although the gale-force headwinds of last year 
are likely to subside, we still expect some gusts 
ahead. For this reason, we continue to recommend 
a tactically neutral allocation to EM equities.

2023 Global Currency Outlook

The US dollar enjoyed a banner year in 2022, 
posting its second consecutive year of broad gains 
and surpassing every other developed market 
currency, as well as all but a handful of those in 
emerging markets (see Exhibit 138). Several factors 
underpinned this outperformance, including the 
most aggressive Federal Reserve hiking cycle in 
decades, along with a global energy shock and 
flagging risk sentiment that prompted investors to 
turn to the dollar as a safe haven. 
 
The yen endured the worst of the US dollar’s 
strength and stood out as the worst-performing 
currency among developed market peers after 
the Swedish krona. Surging import prices and an 
exceptionally accommodative Bank of Japan sent 
the yen 12% lower versus the dollar. The British 
pound also suffered a double-digit downdraft 
against the backdrop of a mini-budget crisis and 
resignation of two prime ministers. Its 11% decline 
was the pound’s worst annual showing since 2016, 
when the UK voted to leave the European Union. 
 
EM currency performance was slightly 
less uniform. While most Asian and European 
currencies fell against the greenback, several Latin 
American currencies—including the Mexican 
peso, Brazilian real and Peruvian sol—posted 
moderate gains. 
 
We expect the interplay of global growth and 
central bank policy to remain a critical driver of the 
US dollar’s path. With real interest rate differentials 

between the US and its developed market peers 
still wide against an uncertain global backdrop, 
our forecast calls for the US dollar to rise in 2023. 
But compared with last year, we expect a smaller 
low-single-digit pace of appreciation and more 
dispersion in the US dollar’s relative performance. 
 
Regardless of our tactical views, we continue 
to recommend that clients fully hedge their 
offshore fixed income. We also recommend that 
US and non-US clients hedge 50% and 70%, 
respectively, of their non-local developed market 
equity holdings to reduce portfolio volatility and 
provide diversification. 

US Dollar
It is hard to find fault with the US dollar’s 
performance over the past decade. Not only has 
the greenback posted eight winning years over this 
period, but it has also advanced 46% since the 
lows of the financial crisis, including an 8% gain 
in 2022 alone. The dollar’s outperformance against 
every other developed market currency last year 
was yet another reminder of its hegemony.
 
Although the dollar index recently traded 
at its highest level in 20 years, we think several 
factors continue to support dollar outperformance. 
For one, US growth is likely to outpace that in 
most other major developed markets this year, 
supporting the positive policy rate differential with 
developed market peers (see Exhibit 139). In turn, 
these policy and growth differentials should entice 
foreign investors to favor US-dollar assets at the

expense of lower-yielding alternatives, providing a 
tailwind to the greenback. Moreover, the end of a 
Federal Reserve hiking cycle—such as is expected 
this year—has typically seen the dollar rise over 
the following six months (see Exhibit 140). Finally, 
noncommercial investors begin the year with light 
US dollar positioning, providing scope for them to 
increase exposure.
 
That said, there are downside risks as well. 
The dollar’s valuation now stands well above its 
long-term average, making the greenback more 
vulnerable (see Exhibit 141). Such disappointments 
could come from abroad—such as materially 
stronger foreign growth or tighter monetary policy 
outside the US—or domestically, if the Federal 
Reserve is forced to abruptly cut rates. While 
it is not our base case, a convergence in global 
monetary policy would potentially erode the yield 
advantage of US assets and thereby weigh on 
the dollar. 
 
Although we still think this balance of risks 
favors a stronger dollar, that appreciation is likely 
to be more modest and more diffuse against other 
global currencies than was the case last year.

Euro
For the second consecutive year, the euro was a 
casualty of the US dollar’s strength. In fact, the 

euro was down 16% at its worst point before 
recovering to a still sizable 6% loss for 2022. 
Although softer economic growth and Russia’s 
invasion of Ukraine were key drivers, last year’s 
weakness continued a string of losses—in seven 
of the last nine years—that began when the ECB

announced plans to cut its deposit rate to below 
zero for the first time in history. 
 
With the euro now nearly 25% below its 2014 
peak, it may appear undervalued relative to its 
history. But this discount may be warranted given 
the many fault lines running through the Eurozone, 
not the least of which is the region’s lack of energy 
security. Structurally higher gas prices resulting 
from a lack of low-cost alternatives to Russian 
energy make the continent’s energy-intensive 
industrial sector less competitive, potentially 
justifying a lower exchange rate relative to history. 
The Eurozone’s capital flow profile represents 
another source of vulnerability for the euro. 
Demand for euro-denominated assets has plunged, 
falling even below levels seen in the sovereign debt 
crisis. Moreover, both the current account and net 
foreign direct investment are in deficit for the first 
time in a decade (see Exhibit 142).
 
Even so, there are several factors that could 
potentially limit the extent of any further euro 
weakness. First, there is a low hurdle for euro-
friendly surprises given that most investors already 
expect a mild recession in the region. Second, the 
euro could benefit from both stronger economic 
activity and a stronger narrow basic balance if a 
warmer winter ends up limiting the need for energy 
rationing and dampening energy prices. Finally, the 
yield advantage of euro-denominated assets could 
improve relative to other developed markets—

thereby supporting the euro—if the ECB needs to 
tighten monetary policy more than expected given 
historically high inflation. 
 
We give a slight edge to the negative factors 
discussed and expect low-single-digit losses for the 
euro relative to the dollar.

Yen
Yen investors are forgiven for feeling whiplashed 
last year. After depreciating close to 25% against 
the US dollar by October—reaching its weakest 
relative level in more than three decades—the yen 
surprised traders with a powerful 15% rally into 
year-end. Despite these wild gyrations, the yen’s 
12% loss in 2022 still ranked as its worst since 
2013 and left it among the worst-performing 
developed market currencies for the second 
consecutive year. 
 
With the yen having now lost nearly a quarter 
of its value since the onset of the pandemic, there 
is certainly scope for last year’s depreciation to 
reverse. Core Japanese inflation is running at its 
highest level in a decade and above the Bank of 
Japan’s 2% target. The BOJ is unlikely to duplicate 
the degree of monetary policy tightening seen 
by other major central banks, not least because 
inflation is expected to fall to near 2% this year. 
But with new BOJ leadership appointments later 
this year, the odds are rising that it will soon 
articulate an endpoint to its near-zero interest rate

policy. Such a development would help narrow 
Japan’s cross-border interest rate differential and 
reduce a recent source of yen weakness. 
 
Also consider that the yen has historically 
performed well during economic slowdowns. While 
a US recession is not our base case, the possibility 
has risen markedly over the past year. Any 
additional global growth headwinds that boost 
risk aversion could lead investors into the yen as a 
liquid hedge, as we saw after the onset of previous 
recessions (see Exhibit 143). 
 
Of course, the yen also still faces several 
obstacles. Japan’s current account surplus has 
halved over the last year given higher import 
prices. In turn, the trade balance shows its 
largest deficit ever (see Exhibit 144). This implies 
marginally less structural demand for the yen and 
may limit its ability to recover to pre-pandemic 
levels. Japanese corporations are also likely to 
generate sustained pressure on the currency, as they 
continue to sell yen to invest in foreign ventures 
with better long-term growth prospects and higher 
yields. Although these outflows slowed during the 
initial stages of the pandemic, they have quickened 
more recently and now stand at about 3.5% of 
GDP, a historically large share. 
 
Taking these factors together, we see scope 
for a mid-single-digit rise in the yen, with the 
possibility of both long and short tactical trading 
opportunities throughout 2023. 

Pound
Along with most other currencies in 2022, the 
pound fell in relation to the US dollar—its second 
consecutive year of underperformance. Last year’s 
11% loss masked a more dramatic 25% peak-
to-trough drawdown in the currency through 
September following a budget crisis and the 
resignation of two prime ministers. This continued 
the currency’s volatile return profile, which dates 
back to 2016 and the United Kingdom’s decision to 
leave the European Union. 
 
We expect further weakness in the pound in 
2023. The UK economy is forecast to contract 
this year, which may limit how much further the 
Bank of England can tighten and opens the door 
for rate cuts in late 2023 or 2024. A less favorable 
absolute policy rate differential with the US could 
also diminish the appeal of the pound to yield-
seeking investors. Moreover, the UK’s position as a 
net energy importer has pushed its current account 
deficit to 4.2% of GDP (see Exhibit 145). This 
too will be a drag on the pound unless the energy 
shock recedes rapidly. 
 
Still, the risks to the pound are not completely 
to the downside. Any combination of better global 
growth or optimism for a faster-than-expected UK 
economic recovery could generate foreign demand 
for UK assets, which would benefit the pound. 
There is certainly scope for better foreign direct 
investment, which currently stands near its weakest 
level since the GFC (see Exhibit 145). In addition,

the political turbulence that has undermined the 
pound may recede in 2023 for a few reasons, 
including last year’s fiscal policy U-turn and the 
lack of any major election or referendum votes 
this year. 
 
On balance, we expect the pound to depreciate 
by modest single digits versus the US dollar 
this year.

Emerging Market Currencies 
EM currencies disappointed again last year. Their 
6.1% decline against the US dollar marked the 
ninth annual loss for the asset class in the past 
decade.52 Over this same period, the asset class has 
cumulatively lost half its nominal value against the 
US dollar.
 
While many factors have contributed to 
this underwhelming decade, Russia’s invasion 
of Ukraine was one of the key drivers of these 
currencies’ weakness last year. Surging commodity 
prices in the wake of the invasion fueled inflation 
across EM, pushing real interest rates into negative 
territory despite an early start to the hiking cycle 
by most EM central banks. Higher energy prices 
were particularly hard on European emerging 
market currencies, which depreciated 10−25% into 
last fall.
 
The hostilities were also accompanied by a 
fast-paced hiking cycle in the US and a broad-
based selloff in risk assets, leading to tighter 
global financial conditions that weighed on EM 

currencies. In Asia, China’s “zero-COVID” policy, 
its multiple lockdowns, and the renminbi’s 15% 
peak-to-trough decline led the rest of that bloc 
into weakness. The one bright spot was Latin 
America, as the currencies of Mexico and Brazil 
ended the year with positive real rates that 
boosted the credibility of their central banks and 
offered investors attractive incremental yields (see 
Exhibit 146).
 
The outlook for 2023 is mixed. On the one 
hand, EM currencies should benefit if the Federal 
Reserve signals an end to its hiking cycle, as 
interest rate differentials favor these currencies. 
On the other hand, investors will want volatility to 
subside before overweighting EM currencies (see 
Exhibit 147). But that stability may prove elusive 
given looming risks, such as a US recession. 
 
In this environment, we expect investors to 
become more selective and favor higher yielding 
currencies with improving macro fundamentals. 
The Chinese renminbi does not cleanly match 
either of these criteria, and we see two key reasons 
it could weaken this year. First, Chinese bonds 
offer less attractive yields, which stand two 
percentage points below US Treasuries. Second, 
the end of “zero-COVID” is likely to put pressure 
on China’s current account as its service deficit 
widens. At a time when other countries’ current 
accounts are set to improve, this will also weigh on 
the renminbi.

Global Fixed Income Outlook 

Most bond investors will be glad to turn the page 
on 2022. A combination of aggressive interest rate 
hikes by global central banks and historically low 
bond yields at the start of the year resulted in deep 
losses for fixed income portfolios last year. The 
Bloomberg Global Aggregate Bond Index fell 16%, 
a decline three times larger than the previous worst 
reading since the benchmark’s inception in 1990. 
While credit fared better than duration—with 
spreads supported by robust nominal growth—all 
fixed income categories suffered losses last year 
(see Exhibit 148). 
 
Fortunately for bondholders, an encore is 
unlikely for several reasons. The higher 
starting level of today’s yields provides 
bond investors with a buffer to absorb 
any further increases in interest rates. 
Moreover, the upward pressure on rates 
from central bank hikes should ease 
given our expectation that the Federal 
Reserve will conclude its tightening cycle 
in the first half of 2023, and that the 
ECB and BOE will do the same shortly 
thereafter. Lastly, our forecast of below-
trend growth implies easing inflationary 
pressures and higher risk of recession, 
both of which increase the odds of 

eventual Federal Reserve rate cuts. Against this 
backdrop, we expect lower 10-year yields across 
most advanced and emerging economies this year.
 
Of course, our constructive view on bonds 
does not imply the absence of risks. Across the US, 
Eurozone and United Kingdom, private markets will 
need to absorb a record $3 trillion in estimated net 
bond supply this year (see Exhibit 149), composed 
of around $2 trillion in net new sovereign debt and 
$1 trillion fewer bond purchases by central banks 
(i.e., quantitative tightening). With central banks 
withdrawing the largest source of demand in recent 
years, there is risk that private investors will require 
higher risk premiums to accommodate the elevated 
funding needs of advanced economies. Continued

The upward pressure on rates from 
central bank hikes should ease given 
our expectation that the Federal 
Reserve will conclude its tightening 
cycle in the first half of 2023, and that 
the ECB and BOE will do the same 
shortly thereafter.

uncertainty around the path of inflation could also 
weigh on bond demand.
 
Still, we think the balance of risks supports 
positive total returns for intermediate fixed income 
in our base case (see Exhibit 150). While cash 
offers attractive returns, unexpected rate cuts by 
the Federal Reserve in response to a growth shock 
could quickly erode its yield. In contrast, high-
quality fixed income is the only asset that has 
effectively hedged against past deflationary shocks. 
 
In the sections that follow, we will review the 
specifics of each major fixed income market.

US Treasuries 
Our 2022 Outlook featured the most negative 
expected returns for US Treasuries that we have 
ever published. Yet the actual losses last year 

exceeded even our pessimistic forecasts. In the case 
of the 10-year Treasury, investors were left with 
a historic 16% loss after its yield registered the 
largest increase in a calendar year on record. 
 
The prospects for 10-year Treasuries are 
brighter now, with the midpoint of our year-end 
3.15–3.65% yield target range implying positive 
high-single-digit returns in 2023. We expect the 
Federal Reserve to conclude its hiking cycle before 
the middle of the year, as its focus shifts from 
curtailing inflation to avoiding a hard landing of 
the economy. The combination of still-restrictive 
policy rates and the market’s expectation of 
eventual rate cuts in response to slowing growth is 
likely to keep the yield curve inverted.
 
Investors are focused on when policy rates and 
bond yields will peak. While history is not a perfect 
guide, it does show that in nearly every hiking 
cycle over the last 40 years, the 10-year Treasury 
yield reached its high before or around the time 
when policy rates peaked. Only twice—in May 
1974 and December 1980—did the 10-year yield 
peak after the policy rate did. Both exceptions 
occurred in a decade of “stop-go” monetary policy 
shifts that ultimately allowed inflation expectations 
to become unanchored. 
 
Yet in contrast with that period, market-based 
inflation expectations now remain well anchored 
following the fastest hiking cycle in decades. 
History suggests that 10-year yields could peak 
before or around the second quarter of this year as 
the Federal Reserve concludes its hiking cycle. In 
fact, yields may have already peaked last year.
 
Prior peaks in the policy rate have been 
followed by large declines in 10-year yields over 
the subsequent year, ranging from 80 basis points 
to 330 basis points. The 3.4% midpoint of our 
forecast range implies a more gradual decline in 
yields than is suggested by history, but we anticipate 
this slower decline for three reasons. First, positive 
economic growth in our base case should support 
yields. Second, we expect inflation to moderate 
but remain above the Federal Reserve’s 
target this year. Finally, the bond market 
will have to absorb around $2 trillion of 
net Treasury supply this year—up from 
$1.6 trillion in 2022—as US funding 
needs remain elevated at a time when 
the Federal Reserve is winding down its 
balance sheet.53

Outlook

Treasuries are sufficiently compelling given similar 
returns from cash and lingering inflation uncertainty. 
We believe so, since unexpected rate cuts by the 
Federal Reserve in response to a growth shock could 
quickly erode the yield on cash. At the same time, 
such a scenario could see 10-year Treasuries deliver 
double-digit total returns, roughly four times larger 
than those of cash (see Exhibit 151). As we often 
highlight, Treasuries are the only asset class that has 
effectively hedged against deflationary shocks in 
the past. 

Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) 
After the fastest Federal Reserve hiking cycle in four 
decades, market-based inflation expectations fell 
sharply from their highs last year and remain well 
anchored near the bank’s 2% inflation target (see 
Exhibit 152). Rising nominal interest rates coupled 
with lower inflation expectations drove 10-year real 
rates higher by a staggering 268 basis points. The 
resulting 12% loss in TIPS last year underperformed 
similar-duration nominal bonds despite the sharpest 
increase in inflation since the 1980s. 
 
We think the outlook for TIPS is brighter in 
2023. With 10-year breakeven inflation rates 
already near the Federal Reserve’s 2% inflation 
target, the scope for further declines is more 

limited. Moreover, TIPS should benefit from some 
retracement in real rates after last year’s surge, 
as we expect stable inflation breakeven rates and 
declining nominal 10-year Treasury yields.
 
Still, TIPS investors face several familiar 
headwinds. For one, TIPS lack the hedging 
qualities of traditional bonds since breakeven 
inflation rates tend to fall during cyclical 
downturns. TIPS are also less liquid than nominal 
Treasuries and hence an inferior source of liquidity 
during market turbulence.54 Additionally, TIPS are 
not tax efficient for taxable clients. For all these 
reasons, we continue to advise US clients with 
taxable accounts to use municipal bonds for their 
strategic allocation.

US Municipal Bonds
There was little to celebrate for municipal bond 
investors last year. The Bloomberg Municipal 
Bond Index fell 8.5%, its worst decline since 1982. 
Similarly, the 4.8% loss in the shorter duration 
1- to 10-year municipal bond index was its worst 
performance since the inception of the index in 
1993. Municipal high yield bonds were not spared 
either, losing 13.1% for the year (see Exhibit 153). 
 
Several factors contributed to this poor 
performance. Chief among these was the nearly

250 basis point increase in the yield on the 
broader municipal bond index last year. This drag 
was made worse by the historically low level of 
municipal bond yields and spreads at the start 
of 2022, which provided little buffer to absorb 
higher rates. The largest exodus from the asset 
class since 1984 was also a material headwind to 
performance. As seen in Exhibit 154, municipal 

bonds registered $118 billion of outflows from 
mutual funds and ETFs in 2022, around twice the 
amount seen during the 2013 “taper tantrum.” 
 
Last year’s poor performance stands in contrast 
to municipal fundamentals, which remain healthy. 
General fund revenue for states grew 14.5% year-
over-year to $1.17 trillion in fiscal 2022, following 
a 16.6% increase in fiscal 2021. Although spending 
rose by 18.3% year-over-year in response to a 
variety of factors, including higher inflation and 
lingering pandemic costs, no state made a budget 
cut due to a revenue shortfall last year. As shown 
in Exhibit 155, the states’ general fund rainy day 
balances grew to an all-time high of $134.5 billion in 
2022, with the median balance as a share of annual 
spending also reaching an all-time high of 11.6%.55 
 
Looking ahead, we expect mid-single-digit nominal 
consumption growth in 2023 to underpin healthy 
sales tax collections. Moreover, our expectation 
for only a modest rise in the unemployment rate 
to 4.1% implies that personal income tax revenues 
should remain resilient. The same could be said for 
property taxes, an area in which it will take a few 
years for recent housing weakness to have an impact. 
 
Consistent with the above, broad credit trends 
remain positive. Consider that credit agency 
upgrades outpaced downgrades by 4.2 times for 
tax-backed issuers and by 2.7 times for revenue-
backed issuers (see Exhibit 156). Based on dollars 
of bond par value, upgrades outpaced downgrades

by a factor of nearly 10 last year, with $327 billion 
of upgrades but just $34 billion of downgrades (see 
Exhibit 157). 
 
While municipal issuer fundamentals are 
sound, valuations in the sector are less appealing. 
As seen in Exhibit 158, the ratio of municipal 
yields to Treasury yields remains below its long-
term average despite last year’s selloff. Similarly, 

the incremental after-tax yield investors earn for 
owning municipal bonds instead of matched-
duration Treasuries also stands well below average 
for both 5-year and 10-year maturities (see Exhibit 
159). The same is true for spreads on the Muni 
1-10 index (see Exhibit 160). 
 
Against this backdrop, we expect US municipal 
bonds to generate a low-single-digit gain this year

that is roughly in line with their current 2.9% 
yield, as a decline in Treasury yields is partially 
offset by some widening in municipal spreads.

US High Yield Municipal Bonds
High yield municipal bonds were not immune 
to last year’s fixed income weakness. Their 
relatively long duration—roughly eight years—was 
particularly costly given sharply higher interest 
rates last year, driving the sector’s 13.1% loss.

headline return, however, with sectors such as 
utilities, transportation and airlines outperforming 
housing, tobacco and hospitals.
 
Like broader municipal bonds, the high yield 
subsector features resilient fundamentals that 
are reflected in tighter than normal spreads. 
As seen in Exhibit 161, the 195 basis points of 
incremental yield these bonds offer relative to 
10-year Treasuries is 60 basis points lower than 
the long-run average spread. This difference is 
explained by solid credit fundamentals; last year’s 
defaults were 41% lower than in 2021 (see Exhibit 
162). Moreover, only 1.4% of these bonds trade 
at distressed spreads, well below the 7.9% average 
since 2008 (see Exhibit 163).
 
With spreads already tight relative to history 
and with economic growth slowing, we expect 
wider spreads to erode part of the benefit of lower 
Treasury yields and the sector’s current 5.9% yield. 
The result would be positive mid-single-digit returns 
in 2023, which in our view argues for clients staying 
invested at their customized strategic weight. 

US Corporate High Yield Credit
Last year was a tumultuous one for corporate 
credit. The 15.8% decline in investment grade 
bonds was the worst since 1973, while the 11.2% 
loss in corporate high yield was its second-worst 
since 1983 (see Exhibits 164 and 165). Although 
bank loans declined as well, their modest 1.14% 

loss was a relative bright spot (see Exhibit 153 in 
the US Municipal Bond section). 
 
The bulk of these losses came from sharply 
higher interest rates rather than credit. In fact, 
the trailing high yield default rate, including 
distressed exchanges, stood at just 1.6% at the end 
of November last year, about half of its long-run 
average. In turn, high yield bond spreads—which 
represent investors’ compensation for taking

but remain well below average (see Exhibit 166). 
The result was that only 3.7% of high yield’s total 
11.2% loss was attributable to wider spreads and 
actual default losses. Similarly, the corporate high 
yield credit default swap index—which reflects just 
the default risk of the underlying bonds—suffered 
a loss of less than 1% last year (see Exhibit 153 in 
the US Municipal Bond section). 

 
Healthy corporate fundamentals help explain 
why high yield bond spreads have remained so 
well-behaved. As seen in Exhibit 167, median 
leverage among high yield issuers has been lower 
only 11% of the time since 1999. At the same 
time, the earnings of the median issuer are four 
times larger than their interest expense, close to the 
highest coverage ratios on record. These figures are 
equally sturdy for leveraged loan borrowers (see 
Exhibit 168). 
 
The underlying credit quality of the high yield 
universe has also improved, with BB-rated bonds 
representing nearly half the index today compared 
to about a third of it historically. Similarly, the 
share of bonds rated CCC and lower—which 
are at higher risk of default—stands below its 
historical average. Issuance by these lower-rated 
companies is also still low relative to history (see 
Exhibit 169). The same could be said for the share 
of LBO and M&A-related issuance, which is 
below its pre-GFC average. Consistent with this 
backdrop, credit rating agency upgrades of high 
yield bonds outpaced downgrades by 1.8 times last 
year based on dollar par value, and recovery rates 
on defaulted securities were well above average. 
 
Whether fundamentals remain resilient in 
the face of slower economic growth this year is 
a critical question facing investors. To be sure, 
several factors point to higher default risk, including 
tightening lending standards for commercial and 
industrial loans, a rising share of securities trading

at distressed spread levels and recent deterioration 
in our preferred leading indicator of defaults (see 
Exhibits 170, 171 and 172). 
 
There is also some credit deterioration already 
evident in the leveraged loan market. Downgraded 
bank loan issuers outnumbered upgraded issuers 

by 1.4 times last year, and the share of the universe 
rated BB has fallen below its long-run average. 
These borrowers—in aggregate—have also not 
adequately hedged their interest rate exposure, 
which becomes a larger drag on their earnings the 
longer rates stay at current levels.

Still, rising defaults should not be equated to 
soaring ones. The default rate ended last year in the 
bottom 15% of its historical distribution, making 
some increase in 2023 very likely. In addition, 
the risk of refinancing-related defaults is low in 
the next two years, with less than 10% of the 
securities in the high yield market maturing (see 
Exhibit 173). Higher interest rates are also likely 
to continue constraining high yield bond issuance 
after it decreased by more than 60% last year.  
 
Against this backdrop, our model implies a 3% 
par-weighted default rate for high yield bonds this 
year, roughly in line with their long-term average 
(see Exhibit 174). The rate is a slightly higher 3.5% 
for leveraged loans, given the idiosyncratic factors 
discussed earlier. With default rates normalizing 
higher, we expect high yield spreads will widen 
to around 550 basis points. Such a spread would 
be sufficient to offer investors an incremental risk 
premium above expected default losses consistent 
with the historical average (see Exhibit 175). Given 
the current level of spreads—including higher 
spreads for leveraged loans, which have a weaker 
credit profile—our forecasts imply mid-single-digit 
total returns for both high yield bonds and bank 
loans this year.

European Bonds
As energy shocks roiled the continent and inflation 
climbed to 40-year highs, European policymakers 
faced an uncomfortable trade-off: sacrifice economic 

growth by confronting inflation through tighter 
monetary policy or dampen the energy shock by 
instituting fiscal stimulus that risked pushing prices 
even higher. UK policymakers decided to try both 
at once, upsetting an already fragile European bond 
complex. Fortunately, subsequent BOE intervention 
and a tighter fiscal budget in the UK ultimately 
prevented broader contagion and stabilized 
European bond markets. Even so, yields rose sharply 
in 2022 and European bonds fell nearly 20%, 
underperforming US Treasuries.
 
Europe faces the same uncomfortable trade-
off in 2023. With inflation pressures still elevated, 
energy supply impaired and the region likely in 
recession, policymakers must tread carefully. Our 
base case calls for the ECB and BOE to extend 
their hiking cycles to a range of 3.25–3.75% and 
4.25–4.75%, respectively. Restrictive monetary 
policy—combined with the hit to disposable 
income from higher energy prices—is likely to 
weigh on growth significantly. Put simply, the 
longer rates stay in restrictive territory, the greater 
the odds the market will price in a deeper-cutting 
cycle by the end of this year. We therefore expect 
German and UK 10-year yields will respectively 
stand about 150 basis points and 125 basis points 
below their policy rate by year-end. 
 
While the outlook for their prices is 
improving, our enthusiasm for European bonds 
is tempered by the elevated volatility that we 
expect. Inflation is likely to decrease even more

gradually in Europe and the UK than in the US, 
increasing the uncertainty this year about whether 
inflation expectations will become unanchored. 
Additionally, weaker economic activity may test 
central bankers’ resolve and lead to more opaque 
forward guidance. Furthermore, both the ECB 
and BOE are attempting to reduce their balance 
sheets at a time when government issuance remains 
elevated, forcing the private sector to absorb 
record net supply in 2023 (see Exhibit 176). 
 
Our expectation that the ECB will extend its 
hiking cycle—a remarkable feat following nearly 
a decade of negative policy rates—comes with 
another unique challenge. The heterogeneous nature 
of the currency bloc means ECB policy impacts 
countries differently. Consider that real rates in 
Italy stand more than two percentage points above 
those in Germany despite substantially lower 
potential growth. Higher funding costs 
in the economies least able to bear them 
are likely to ignite concerns around 
debt sustainability, putting pressure on 
peripheral spreads. Against this backdrop, 
and despite expecting German 10-year 
yields to fall toward our 1.75–2.25% 
forecast range, we recommend a neutral 
stance to peripheral bonds.
 
The BOE also faces several hurdles. 
First, the policy debacle last September 
remains fresh in investors’ minds, 

meaning tolerance for negative surprises will be 
more limited and the risk premium priced into 
the bonds by investors more persistent. Second, 
the nature of the UK mortgage market results 
in rapid transmission of monetary policy. With 
around half the stock of mortgages repricing this 
year to much higher rates, many households will 
see their monthly mortgage payments double, 
denting disposable income.56 Third, net supply of 
gilts the private sector must absorb is estimated to 
quadruple to £260 billion. Based on the foregoing, 
we expect term premium in the UK gilt market 
will remain elevated through 2023, supporting our 
3.0–3.5% target range for 10-year gilt yields.

Emerging Market Local Debt 
Investors fled from emerging market local debt 
(EMLD) in 2022. The asset class saw $44.1 
billion in outflows last year, which pushed foreign 
holdings of domestic government securities to 
below the 15-year average.57 The 11.7% loss in 
EMLD last year represented its second consecutive 
annual decline. 
 
We think divergences across regions will be 
critical to the EMLD outlook in 2023. While 
monetary policy tightening cycles are close to 
ending in most EM countries, the dispersion of 
terminal rates is wide. Brazil and Hungary, for 
instance, will potentially end their cycles with 
policy rates near 14%, compared with near 2% 
in Korea and Thailand. Similarly, interest rate 
differentials between domestic yields and US yields 
are much narrower in Asia than in Latin America, 
Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and 
Africa (see Exhibit 177). These divergences should 
precipitate tactical opportunities during the year. 
 
More broadly, we think EMLD could benefit 
this year as inflation moderates, especially if 
central banks begin easing cycles and fiscal policies 
remain prudent, keeping yield curves anchored.

Supply to the Private Sector

january 2023

Our cautious optimism on EMLD is reflected in 
our mid-single-digit EMLD total return forecast 
for 2023, which also reflects EMLD’s 6.8% yield 
net of the 1.5% drag we expect from currency 
depreciation and 0.4% positive contribution 
arising from duration. 

Emerging Market Dollar Debt 
Emerging market dollar debt (EMD) was held 
hostage by higher US Treasury yields in 2022. As 
seen in Exhibit 178, EMD’s 18% loss last year 
represented the worst annual return since its 
inception in 1993. The bulk of this loss resulted 
from the sharp increase in US Treasury yields, as 
EMD spreads ended the year around their 10-year 
average, despite significant widening in countries 
such as Pakistan and Sri Lanka (see Exhibit 179).
 
As the market shifts its focus from high 
inflation to slower growth in 2023, we believe 
that spreads are likely to face more pressure than 
they did last year. History corroborates this view, 
as EMD spreads have typically widened by 250 
basis points during mild recessions and 650 basis 
points during deeper global downturns. Even so, 
the drag from wider spreads this year should be 
more than offset by EMD’s yield and the benefit 
from its longer, nearly seven-year duration given 
the lower US Treasury yields we expect. Taking 
all these factors into account, we forecast positive 
low-single-digit EMD returns in 2023.

second consecutive year. But this impressive gain 
belied a more nuanced reality, as returns reached 
54% by early June, only to be halved in the 
second half of the year. Investors also faced a wide 
dispersion among individual commodities and their 
source of returns. In contrast to the index’s overall 
strength, both industrial metals and precious 
metals suffered losses last year. And while the 
energy subindex outperformed with a 39% gain, 
the bulk of this came from positive carry, or the 
additional return holders of a commodity get when 
the futures curve is strongly downward sloping, 
called “backwardation.” The appreciation in spot 
energy prices was a much smaller 14%.  
 
The disjointed nature of these returns reflects 
the tug-of-war between bullish supply-side 
pressures and bearish demand-side concerns that is 
likely to continue in the year ahead. Although years 
of underinvestment are an underlying support for 
many commodity prices, a deeper global economic 
slowdown could quickly undermine demand, 
especially given the still-uncertain trajectory of 
China’s economy amid its shifting COVID policies. 
 
Against these risks, we note that global 
inventories have remained low across most 
commodities despite months of weak Chinese 
demand—a sign of equally weak supply trends. A 
thinner inventory buffer also leaves prices sensitive 
to potential supply disruptions in politically 
unstable areas, such as South America for base 
metals, or—discussed further below—Russia and 
the Middle East for oil. Given these crosscurrents, 
we believe that risks around our base case are 
roughly balanced for industrial metals and oil 
prices this year. As for gold, we remain doubtful 
about its ability to provide investors with a reliable 
hedge against inflation or political risk given its 
notable failure to do so in the past year.  

Oil: High Risks, Low Inventories
Oil prices last year were driven by geopolitical 
developments to a degree not seen since the 
turbulent 1970s. As seen in Exhibit 181, close 
to 10% of global oil production found itself at 
risk of disruption virtually overnight in the wake 
of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing 
rollout of Western sanctions. Given already low 
global oil inventories and thin spare capacity, oil 
prices understandably spiked higher, reaching $124 
at their peak closing level last March. 
 
Prices have since fallen back below pre-war 
levels. This surprising retracement reflects not only 
the failure of supply risks to materialize, but also 
a combination of bearish developments, including 
an unprecedented 200-million-barrel release from 
the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a COVID-
driven slump in Chinese oil demand and fears of 
an impending recession.

Although oil prices have receded, the bullish 
risks that underpinned their initial spike higher 
have not disappeared. The full effect of European 
sanctions on Russia will not be visible in energy 
markets until the first quarter of this year. These 
curbs directly impact 0.5 million b/d of seaborne 
crude oil and 1.1 million b/d of refined products. 
While Russia has so far been successful at 
redirecting crude exports to India and China, this 
strategy is starting to show some limits (see Exhibit 
182). Moreover, it will be difficult for Russia to 
replicate this strategy in refined products, as both 
China and India were net exporters in this category 
last year.
 
As a result, close to 2 million b/d of Russian 
supplies to Europe remain at risk. Consensus 
currently expects a net loss of less than half that 
amount, increasing the risk of an upside surprise. 
Upward pressure on energy prices could also 
arise from supply disruptions in other countries, 
given geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and 
domestic instability in Libya and other exporting 
countries.  
 
To be sure, the demand for oil faces an equally 
high degree of risk amid a potential US recession and 
the still-uncertain trajectory of China’s economy. We 
estimate that Chinese demand fell by 0.5 million b/d 
on average last year, marking the first annual decline 
since 1990 (see Exhibit 183). While a successful 
reopening of China’s economy could help offset 
weaker oil demand elsewhere, a more protracted 

COVID wave could exacerbate demand concerns. 
For now, we expect global demand to remain on an 
upward trajectory in our base case, exceeding pre-
COVID levels by year-end.  
 
Meeting this demand will require continuing 
growth from US producers, as OPEC has already 
ramped its output back to pre-COVID levels 
and has limited spare capacity. But to incentivize 
additional drilling, oil prices must remain high 
enough to overcome the cost inflation and self-
imposed capital discipline now holding back 
US production. In contrast, lower prices and 
disappointing demand would likely restrain 
production growth. Tellingly, the November and 
December oil price slump was rapidly followed by 
a decline in US drilling and completion activity, 
while OPEC immediately announced a production 
cut to rescue prices. 
 
Given these moving pieces, we expect WTI 
prices to trade in a $70–100 range by year-end, 
which would imply upside from current levels. 
But we are mindful of the many risks that could 
undermine this forecast—including a US recession, 
another wave of global COVID infections or a 
quick resolution to the conflict in Ukraine—any 
one of which could push prices down to cost 
support near $60. That said, we would not expect 
these lower prices to be sustained for an extended 
period, given producers’ likely reaction. There are 
also upside risks. Any additional supply disruptions 
would be magnified by still-low inventories (see

Exhibit 184), which could push prices above our 
forecast range, as happened last year. 
 
Although we do not have an active tactical 
allocation to oil, we do continue to recommend 
a small overweight to the US midstream sector, 
which benefits from strong cash flows and less 
direct exposure to oil price volatility.

Gold: Not as Advertised
Since its meteoric rise in the 1970s, gold has been 
hailed as an effective hedge against inflation. But 
that reputation was tarnished in 2022, as gold 
prices spent most of the year trading in negative 
territory despite the highest inflation in four 
decades. This disappointing performance was 
yet another reminder that gold is subject to a 
multitude of often opposing factors. Case in point: 
the impact of last year’s inflation surprise was 
largely offset by the combination of higher interest 
rates and the surge in the US dollar, with which 
gold tends to be negatively correlated.
 
These types of crosscurrents leave us tactically 
neutral on gold again this year. As seen in Exhibit 
185, our expectation for softer nominal and 
real interest rates removes one of last year’s key 
headwinds to gold. Yet real rates are still likely 
to remain in positive territory, which historically 
has resulted in lower-than-average gold returns 
(see Exhibit 186). After all, positive interest rates 
create an opportunity cost of holding gold, which 

generates no cash flow or yield income and must 
be physically stored, often at a cost. 
 
We also do not see a compelling argument for 
investors to replace their US dollar holdings with 
gold this year, given our still constructive view on 
the currency. Consider that since 1971, there has 
been only a 24% chance of a meaningful gold

rally of more than 10% in periods when the dollar 
was stable or rising. In fact, most meaningful 
gold rallies have happened when the US dollar 
was depreciating. Put simply, when the dollar is 
appreciating—a situation we expect this year—
the low probability of strong gold returns has 
not historically justified the risk and volatility of 
holding the yellow metal.   
 
Still, there are a few factors that could buoy 
gold, not the least of which is a US recession that 
might rekindle demand for gold as a safe-haven 
asset. Gold also stands to benefit if currently 
underweight investors increase their positions 
(see Exhibit 187), which now stand 28% below 
their recent peak in early 2022 and back at levels 
last seen in early 2020. Demand from EM central 
banks looking to diversify their FX reserves into 
gold is another source of upside risk. The latest 
data from the World Gold Council already points 
to record-high purchases in the most recent 
quarter, with countries such as Turkey, China and 
India leading the pack. Further geopolitical strife 
could even accelerate this trend.  
 
Given these contradictory factors, we remain 
neutral on gold until a clearer opportunity 
presents itself.

While still historically elevated, investor length in gold is

Investment Strategy Group (“ISG”). 
The Investment Strategy Group, part 
of the Asset & Wealth Management 
business (“AWM”) of GS, focuses on 
asset allocation strategy formation 
and market analysis for GS Wealth 
Management. Any information that 
references ISG, including their model 
portfolios, represents the views of 
ISG, is not financial research and is 
not a product of GS Global Investment 
Research and may vary significantly 
from views expressed by individual 
portfolio management teams within 
AWM, or other groups at GS. ISG 
Model Portfolios are provided for 
illustrative purposes only. Your actual 
asset allocation may look significantly 
different based on your particular 

circumstances and risk tolerance. 
Model performance calculations 
assume that (1) each asset class 
was owned in accordance with the 
recommended weight; (2) all tactical 
tilts were tracked at the time the 
recommendation was made; and (3) the 
portfolios are rebalanced at the end 
of every quarter. Model performance 
is calculated using the daily returns 
(actual or interpolated) of indices 
that ISG believes are representative 
of the asset classes included in the 
model. Results shown reflect the total 
return but generally do not consider 
any investment management fees, 
commissions or other transaction 
expenses, which would reduce 
returns. Hedge fund indices and data 
from Cambridge Associates are net 
of manager fees. The results shown 
reflect the reinvestment of dividends 
and other earnings. All returns are pre-
tax and are not adjusted for inflation. 
Additional information about the model 
portfolio performance calculations is 
available upon request. 

Investment Risks and Information. 
GS&Co. offers a range of products that 
you should carefully consider for their 
unique terms and risks prior to investing 
to ensure they are appropriate for 
your individual circumstances. Below 
are descriptions of major risks for our 
more complex products; please review 
the offering documents and product 
prospectuses for particular products, 
as well as additional information about 
the nature and risks of these and other 
products in GS&Co.’s ADV Part 2A 
Brochure and PWM Relationship Guide. 
Investing involves the risk of loss. 

Alternative Investments (“AI”). AIs may 
involve a substantial degree of risk, 
including the risk of total loss of capital, 
use of leverage, lack of liquidity, and 
volatility of returns. Private equity, 
private credit, private real estate, 
hedge funds, and AI investments 
structured as private investment funds 
are subject to less regulation than other 
types of pooled vehicles. Review the 
Offering Memorandum, Subscription 
Agreement, and any other applicable 
offering documents for risks, potential 
conflicts of interest, terms and 
conditions and other disclosures. 

Commodities. The risk of loss in trading 
commodities can be substantial due, 
but not limited, to lack of liquidity, 
volatile political, market, and economic 
conditions, and abrupt changes in price 
which may result from unpredictable 
factors including weather, labor strikes, 
inflation, foreign exchange rates, etc. 
Due to the use of leverage, a small 
move against your position may result 
in a loss that may be larger than your 
initial deposit.

Currencies. Currency exchange rates 
can be extremely volatile, particularly 
during times of political or economic 
uncertainty. There is a risk of loss when 

an investor has exposure to foreign 
currency or holds foreign currency 
traded investments.

Digital Assets/Cryptocurrency. 
Digital assets regulation is still 
developing across all jurisdictions 
and governments may in the future 
restrict the use and exchange of any 
or all digital assets. Digital assets are 
generally not backed nor supported by 
any government or central bank, are not 
FDIC insured and do not have the same 
protections that U.S. or other countries’ 
bank deposits may have and are more 
volatile than traditional currencies. 
Transacting in digital assets carries 
the risk of market manipulation and 
cybersecurity failures such as the risk 
of hacking, theft, programming bugs, 
and accidental loss. Differing forms of 
digital assets may carry different risks. 
The volatility and unpredictability of 
the price of digital assets may lead to 
significant and immediate losses.

Over-the-Counter (“OTC”) Derivatives. 
OTC derivatives are illiquid as there is 
no public market. The price or valuation 
of each OTC derivative transaction 
is individually negotiated between 
GS&Co. and each counterparty, and 
GS&Co. does not represent or warrant 
that the prices for which it offers OTC 
derivative transactions are the best 
prices available. You may therefore 
have trouble establishing whether 
the price you have been offered for a 
particular OTC derivative transaction 
is fair. OTC derivatives may trade 
at a value that is different from the 
level inferred from interest rates, 
dividends, and the underlier due to 
factors including expectations of future 
levels of interest rates and dividends, 
and the volatility of the underlier prior 
to maturity. The market price of the 
OTC derivative transaction may be 
influenced by many unpredictable 
factors, including economic conditions, 
GS creditworthiness, the value of any 
underliers, and certain actions taken 
by GS. Because GS may be obligated 
to make substantial payments to you 
as a condition of an OTC derivative 
transaction, you must evaluate the 
credit risk of doing business with GS. 
Depending on the type of transaction, 
your counterparty may be GS&Co. or 
another GS affiliate. Counterparties 
may be subject to different rules 
depending on whether they are a 
registered U.S. broker dealer. OTC 
derivative transactions with GS 
affiliates cannot be assigned or 
transferred without GS’s prior written 
consent. The provisions of an OTC 
derivative transaction may allow for 
early termination and, in such cases, 
either you or GS may be required 
to make a potentially significant 
termination payment depending 
upon whether the OTC derivative 
transaction is in-the-money at the time 
of termination. You should carefully 
review the Master Agreement, 
including any related schedules, credit 
support documents, addenda, and 
exhibits. You may be requested to post 
margin or collateral at levels consistent 
with the internal policies of GS to 
support written OTC derivatives

Emerging Markets and Growth 
Markets. Emerging markets and 
growth markets investments involve 
certain considerations, including 
political and economic conditions, 
the potential difficulty of repatriating 
funds or enforcing contractual or other 
legal rights, and the small size of the 
securities markets in such countries 
coupled with a low volume of trading, 
resulting in potential lack of liquidity 
and price volatility.

Non-US Securities. Non-US securities 
investments are subject to differing 
regulations, less public information, 
less liquidity, and greater volatility in 
the countries of domicile of the security 
issuers and/or the jurisdiction in which 
these securities are traded. In addition, 
investors in securities such as ADRs/
GDRs, whose values are influenced by 
foreign currencies, effectively assume 
currency risk.

Options. The purchase of options 
can result in the loss of an entire 
investment and the risk of uncovered 
options is potentially unlimited. You 
must read and understand the current 
Options Disclosure Document before 
entering into any options transactions. 
The booklet entitled Characteristics 
and Risk of Standardized Options can 
be obtained from your PWM team or at 
http://www.theocc.com/components/
docs/riskstoc.pdf. A secondary market 
may not be available for all options. 
Transaction costs may be significant in 
option strategies that require multiple 
purchases and sales of options, such as 
spreads. Supporting documentation for 
any comparisons, recommendations, 
statistics, technical data, or other 
information will be supplied upon 
request. 

Real Estate. Real estate investments, 
including real estate investments 
trusts (“REITS”) and non-traded REITS, 
involve additional risks not typically 
associated with other asset classes. 
Such investments (both through public 
and private markets) may be subject 
to changes in broader macroeconomic 
conditions, such as interest rates, and 
sensitivities to temporary or permanent 
reductions in property values for the 
geographic region(s) represented. 
Non-traded REITS may carry a higher 
risk of illiquidity, incomplete or 
nontransparent valuations, dilution of 
shares, and conflicts of interest. 

Structured Investments. Structured 
investments are complex and investors 
assume the credit risk of the issuer or 
guarantor. If the issuer or guarantor 
defaults, you may lose your entire 
investment, even if you hold the 
product to maturity. Structured 

investments often perform differently 
from the asset(s) they reference. Credit 
ratings may pertain to the credit rating 
of the issuer and are not indicative of 
the market risk associated with the 
structured investment or the reference 
asset. Each structured investment is 
different, and for each investment you 
should consider 1) the possibility that 
at expiration you may be forced to own 
the reference asset at a depressed 
price; 2) limits on the ability to share in 
upside appreciation; 3) the potential for 
increased losses if the reference asset 
declines; and 4) potential inability to 
sell given the lack of a public trading 
market.

Tactical Tilts. Tactical tilts may involve 
a high degree of risk. No assurance can 
be made that profits will be achieved 
or that substantial losses will not 
be incurred. For various reasons, GS 
may implement a tactical tilt, invest 
in an affiliated fund that may invest 
in tactical tilts, or unwind a position 
for its client advisory accounts or on 
its own behalf before your advisor 
does on behalf of your account, or 
may implement a tactical tilt that 
is different from the tactical tilt 
implemented by advisors on client 
accounts, which could have an adverse 
effect on your account and may result 
in poorer performance by your account 
than by GS or other client accounts.

U.S. Registered Mutual Funds / 
Exchange Traded Funds (“ETFs”) or 
Exchange Traded Notes (“ETNs”). You 
should consider a fund’s investment 
objectives, risks, and costs, and read 
the summary prospectus and/or the 
Prospectus (which may be obtained 
from your PWM Team) carefully before 
investing. You may obtain documents 
for ETFs or ETNs for free by 1) visiting 
EDGAR on the SEC website at http://
www.sec.gov/; 2) contacting your 
PWM Team; or 3) calling toll-free at 
1-866-471-2526. Unlike traditional 
mutual funds, ETFs can trade at a 
discount or premium to the net asset 
value and are not directly redeemable 
by the fund. Leveraged or inverse ETFs, 
ETNs, or commodities futures-linked 
ETFs may experience greater price 
movements than traditional ETFs 
and may not be appropriate for all 
investors. Most leveraged and inverse 
ETFs or ETNs seek to deliver multiples 
of the performance (or the inverse of 
the performance) of the underlying 
index or benchmark on a daily basis. 
Their performance over a longer period 
of time can vary significantly from the 
stated daily performance objectives 
or the underlying benchmark or index 
due to the effects of compounding. 
Performance differences may be 
magnified in a volatile market. 
Commodities futures-linked ETFs may 
perform differently than the spot price 
for the commodity itself, including due 
to the entering into and liquidating 
of futures or swap contracts on a 
continuous basis to maintain exposure 

(i.e., “rolling”) and disparities between 
near term future prices and long 
term future prices for the underlying 
commodity. You should not assume 
that a commodity-futures linked ETF 
will provide an effective hedge against 
other risks in your portfolio.

Security-Specific References. 
References to a specific company 
or security are intended solely as 
examples or for context and are not 
research or investment advice; do not 
rely upon them in making an investment 
decision. GS may have a relationship 
with such companies and/or its 
securities that may present conflicts of 
interest. Contact your PWM Team for 
further information on any securities 
mentioned. 

Off-Platform Investments. If you ask 
us for guidance on external investment 
opportunities not offered by GS, any 
information we may provide is as an 
accommodation only and we will not 
be acting as your advisor. We assume 
no obligation to determine whether 
the opportunity is suitable for you 
in connection with such investment 
decisions and will not assume any 
liability for such investment decisions. 
Our Form ADV has information on 
conflicts of interest we may have in 
connection with any such requests.
ISG/GIR Forecasts. Economic 
and market forecasts presented 
(“forecasts”) generally reflect either 
ISG’s or Goldman Sachs Global 
Investment Research’s (“GIR”) views 
and are subject to change without 
notice. Forecasts do not consider 
investment objectives, restrictions, tax 
and financial situations or other needs 
of any specific client. Forecasts are 
subject to high levels of uncertainty 
that may affect actual performance 
and represents only one of a broad 
range of possible outcomes. Forecasts 
and any return expectations are as of 
the date of this material, and do not 
project returns of any given investment 
or strategy. Forecasts are estimated, 
based on capital market assumptions, 
and are subject to significant revision 
and may change materially as economic 
and market conditions change. Any 
case studies and examples are for 
illustrative purposes only. If applicable, 
a copy of the GIR Report used for GIR 
forecasts is available upon request. 
Forecasts do not reflect advisory fees, 
transaction costs, and other expenses 
a client would have paid, which would 
reduce return.

Client Specific Markets. 
Investments held in your name with a 
subcustodian in the local market where 
traded in order to comply with local law 
will be indicated on your statements.

Performance / Estimated Income 
/ Estimated Cash Flow. Past 
performance is not a guide of future 
results and may include investments 
no longer owned in current or closed 

accounts. Current performance may be 
lower or higher than the performance 
data quoted. Where not relevant 
or representative, outliers may be 
excluded. To request the most current 
or historical performance data, or asset 
classification schema information, 
please contact your PWM team at 
the number provided on your monthly 
statement or toll-free in the U.S. at 
1-800-323-5678. 

Performance reports, where shown, 
generally present the relevant 
time weighted performance, which 
is a combination of daily returns 
compounded over a specified time 
period with the removal of the 
deposit and withdrawal impacts, 
and may show internal rate of return 
calculations where requested. 
Aggregate performance may not equal 
the sum of returns at an investment 
level. Where performance is shown 
net of fees, actual fees may differ. Net 
performance for advisory accounts is 
calculated net of fees and expenses 
that were or would have been paid 
in connection with GS’s services, 
including management fees, and 
might include investments for which 
actual market prices are not currently 
available. If included, estimated 
income figures and estimated private 
equity future cash flows are estimates 
of future activity, and actual results 
may vary substantially. GS&Co. has 
adjusted performance calculations for 
certain asset classes or strategies and 
may do so in the future. Performance 
of net cash (i.e., cash less margin 
debit) is generally included in the 
total performance calculation but 
not displayed separately. Option 
performance is included in the 
performance of the asset class of the 
underlier. 

Offer to Provide Additional 
Performance Information. 
Where GS provides you with the 
results of a subset of investments 
extracted from a portfolio (“extracted 
performance”), you may request 
the performance results of the total 
portfolio. Where GS provides you with 
illustrative performance regarding 
private fund investments that was not 
actually achieved by GS (“hypothetical 
performance”), you may request 
additional information regarding the 
risks and limitations of using such 
performance. 

Indices/Benchmarks. 
References to indices, benchmarks, 
or other measures of relative market 
performance over a specified 
period are informational only and 
are not predictions or guarantees 
of performance. In addition to the 
benchmark assigned to a specific 
investment strategy, other benchmarks 
(“Comparative Benchmarks”) may be 
displayed, including ones displayed 
at your request. Managers may not 
review the performance of your 
account against the performance of 
Comparative Benchmarks. Where a 
benchmark for a strategy has changed, 
the historical benchmark(s) are 
available upon request. Inception to 
date (“ITD”) returns and benchmark/
reference portfolio returns may reflect 
different periods. ITD returns for 
accounts or asset classes only reflect 
performance during periods in which 
your account(s) held assets and/
or were invested in the asset class. 
The benchmark or reference portfolio 
returns shown reflect the benchmark 
/ portfolio performance from the date 
of inception of your account or your 
initial investment in the asset class. If 
displayed, estimated income figures are 
estimates of future activity obtained 
from third party sources. 
Indices are unmanaged and investors 
cannot directly invest in them. The 
figures for the index reflect the 
reinvestment of all income or dividends, 
as applicable, but may not always 
reflect the deduction of any fees or 
expenses which would reduce returns. 
Where appropriate, relevant index 
trademarks or index information has 
been licensed or sub-licensed for use. 
Inclusion of index information does not 
mean the relevant index or its affiliated 
entities sponsor, endorse, sell, or 
promote the referenced securities, 
or that they make any representation 
or warranty regarding either the 
advisability of investing in securities or 
the ability of the index to track market 
performance. 

Pricing and Valuations.
Prices do not necessarily reflect 
realizable values and are based on 
information considered to be reliable 
but are not guaranteed for accuracy, 
currency, or as realizable values. Certain 
positions may be provided by third 
parties or may appear without a price 
if GS is unable to obtain a price and/or 
the security is not actively traded for a 
certain amount of time. Pricing sources 
and methods are available upon request 
and are subject to change.

Consolidated Reporting and Third 
Party Investments. 
Where GS provides a consolidated report 
or references information regarding your 
non-GS investments held by third party 
custodians, such information provided 
as a courtesy for informational purposes 
only; it is not your official statement. 
Such information (including valuof any 
materials/information provided to us. 
GS does not perform review or diligence 
on, independently verify the accuracy 
of information regarding, or provide 
advice on such non-GS investments; 
GS assumes no responsibility for the 
accuracy of the source information and 
such assets may not be included on GS’s 
books and records. Unless otherwise 
agreed in writing, we have not assessed 
whether those investments fit within 
your investment objective and the asset 
classification shown may not be accurate 
and/or may differ from your custodian 

or external adviser’s classification. You 
should maintain the original source 
documents (including third party financial 
statements) and review them for any 
notices or relevant disclosures. Assets 
held away may not be covered by SIPC. 

Tax Information. 
GS does not provide legal, tax or 
accounting advice, unless explicitly 
agreed in writing between you and GS, 
and does not offer the sale of insurance 
products. You should obtain your own 
independent tax advice based on 
your circumstances. The information

including your Form 1099, Schedule 
K-1 for private investments, which we 
will provide to you annually, or your 
monthly GS account statement(s). The 
cost basis included in this presentation 
may differ from your cost basis for tax 
purposes. Information regarding your 
AIs and transactions for retirement 
accounts are not included in the Tax 
Summary section.

Retirement Plan / IRA / Coverdell 
Education Savings Account 
(collectively, “Retirement 
Account”) Clients: Information 
regarding your Retirement Account(s) 
included in this presentation is for 
informational purposes only and does 
not constitute investment or other 
advice or a recommendation relating 
to any investment or other decisions, 
and GS is not a fiduciary or advisor with 
respect to any person or plan by reason 
of providing the presentation including

GSFO Services. Where GS&Co. 
provides or refers GSFO Services, 
it does so based on individual client 
needs. Not all clients will receive all 
services and certain activities may fall 
beyond the scope of the GSFO Services. 
Any asset management services 
provided are governed by a separate 
investment management agreement 
(as may be applicable). Personnel 
providing GSFO Services do not provide 
discretionary management over client 
investments. Where GSFO provides 
art or collectibles advisory services, 
such services are generally limited to 
education; GS does not recommend 
purchasing art or collectibles as an 
investment strategy, provide formal 
or informal appraisals of the value 

of, or opine on the future investment 
potential of, any specific artwork or 
collectible. Any discussions of pending 
legislation, or hypothetical projections 
based on same, are educational and 
should not be construed as or relied 
upon as investment, tax, or legal 
advice. Upon your request, the Family 
Office team may discuss with you 
various aspects of financial planning; 
the scope of such planning services 
will vary among clients and may only 
include episodic and educational 
consultations that should not be viewed 
as tax advice. GS&Co. assumes no 
duty to take action pursuant to any 
recommendations, advice, or financial 
planning strategies discussed with 
you as part of GSFO Services. It is 
your responsibility to determine if 
and how any such recommendations, 
advice, or financial planning strategies 
should be implemented or otherwise 
followed, and you are encouraged to 
consult with your own tax advisor and 
other professionals regarding your 
specific circumstances. GS is not liable 
for any services received from your 
independent advisors or the results 
of any incident arising from any such 
services or advice. Cybersecurity 
consultations provided by GS&Co. are 
intended to provide a general overview 
of cyber and physical security threats, 
but are not comprehensive; GS is not 
liable for any incident following such 
consultations. GS&Co. is not liable 
for clients’ ultimate selection and 
utilization of any Third Party Vendor 
for any GSFO Services, or the results 
of any incident arising from any such 
referral. GS&Co. is not responsible 
for the supervision, monitoring, 
management, or performance of such 
Third Party Vendors and is not liable 
for any failure of Third Party Vendors to 
render services or any losses incurred 
as a result of such services. Ayco 
Family Office Services may also be 
offered through Ayco. These services 
are separate and distinct from those 
services provided by GSFO, and may 
vary substantially. 

Other Services. Any provided 
financial planning services, 
including cash flow analyses 
based on information you provide, 
are hypothetical illustrations of 
mathematical principles and are not a 
prediction or projection of performance 
of an investment or investment 
strategy. Certain illustrations may be 
predicated on an Investment Analysis 
tool, an interactive technological 
tool that produces simulations and 
statistical analyses that present 
the likelihood of various investment 
outcomes based on client input. Such 
services may not address every aspect 
of a client’s financial life; topics that 
were not discussed with you may still 
be relevant to your financial situation. 
In providing financial services, GS relies 
on information provided by you and 
is not responsible for the accuracy or 
completeness of any such information, 

nor for any consequences related to 
the use of any inaccurate or incomplete 
information. Where materials and/
or analyses are provided to you, they 
are based on the assumptions stated 
therein, which are likely to vary 
substantially from the examples shown 
if they do not prove to be true. These 
examples are for illustrative purposes 
only and do not guarantee that any 
client will or is likely to achieve the 
results shown. Assumed growth rates 
are subject to high levels of uncertainty 
and do not represent actual trading 
and may not reflect material economic 
and market factors that may have an 
impact on actual performance. GS has 
no obligation to provide updates to 
these rates.

where GS expressly agrees otherwise, 
GS is not acting as a municipal advisor 
and the opinions or views contained in 
this presentation are not intended to be, 
and do not constitute, advice, including 
within the meaning of Section 15B of the
