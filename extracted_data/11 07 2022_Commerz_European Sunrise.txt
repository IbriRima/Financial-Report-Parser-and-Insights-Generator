Wobbly balance

 

Rates: Bunds look set to remain vulnerable near-term as upcoming US inflation data
adds weight to the Fed's front-loading while still solid activity data bolsters risk
sentiment. Downside remains limited though as gas anxiety continues.

Supply: Modest EGB supply of €16.5bn from Germany, Netherlands, Greece and Italy
meets decent €30.5bn backflows. In SSAs, the first H2 NGEU syndication and the KFW
mid-year funding update will be in focus at the start of the week.

Overnight News

ECB: Holzmann says ECB should hike rates by 50bp in July and by 75bp in September, if
inflation outlook doesn't improve. Stournaras sees 25bp hike "very likely" in July, hopes that
new instrument will surprise markets "on the positive side" as a "strong" tool could stay on
the shelf.

Euro area: BBG poll shows 55% recession risk in Germany and 45% in euro area (up from
30% last month), inflation to peak this quarter, and ECB raising depo rate to 1.25% by March.

Fed: Williams sees 50 or 75bp July hike on the table. He expects GDP growth below 1% in
2022 and around 1.5% in 2023.

Gas: Canada returns sanctioned gas turbine to Germany by issuing "time-limited and
revocable" permit. French FinMin Le Maire says total Russian gas cut-off is most likely
scenario.

France: Govt mulls extending energy tariff shield beyond 2022 on targeted basis for poorest
households, PM Borne says.

Sanctions: EU is working to improve enforcement of its sanctions against Russia (WSJ).

Ratings: Fitch affirms Greece at BB/positive, ESM at AAA/stable, EFSF at AA, raises outlook
for US (AAA) to stable citing improved debt dynamics and downgrades Turkey one notch to B/
negative. DBRS confirms Netherlands at AAA/stable.

China: CPI rises stronger than expected to 2.5% in June (exp. 2.4%), PPI slows less than
expected to 6.1% (exp. 6.0%). June CPI won't stand in the way of more stimulus, state media
says. Covid-19 cases in Shanghai continue to rise, incl. first case of BA.5. Property developer
Ronshine misses payments on senior notes.

Japan: Ruling LDP and its junior partner increase majority in upper house election to 76 seats
(out of 125).

Markets: USTs trade rangebound near Friday's lows. Upbeat Nikkei on election, downbeat
China stocks on Covid situation, e-minis weaken. DXY recovers, Yen falls to new low. Brent
holds above $106/bbl.

Rates and Credit Strategy | European Sunrise
Rates: Wobbly balance

Bunds remain vulnerable near-term as headwinds persist. The gas anxiety continues with the
11-day maintenance period for Nord Stream 1 starting today but the data turns the focus on
Fed tightening, while hawkish ECB talk (Holzmann) continues ahead of the blackout period
beginning on Thursday. As rising rate expectations could weigh on risk sentiment, cross-market
feedback loops could provide support though.

The US-Treasury curve shifted some 8bp higher following the strong payroll report, with the
2-10y curve remaining inverted. 20y remains the cheapest point on the curve with the nominal
yield having risen above 3.55%, driven by both higher break-evens and a higher real TIPS yield
above 1.25%.

A likely new record high US inflation print this week should tip the balance for a 75bp hike
later this month, which is virtually priced in by now. Fed expectations are shifting higher again,
but remain inverted beyond March-2023 (see left-hand chart below).

The front-loaded Fed tightening is also spilling over to €STR forwards with the market pricing
slightly more than 25bp ECB lift-off this month and 50bp in September. The €STR forwards for
2023 remain lower on the week though given euro area recession fears (see right-hand chart
below). A crucial litmus test for the tightening pattern could come much earlier though with the
planned end of the Nord Stream 1 maintenance targeted to end one day after the ECB lift-off
decision.

Lingering recession risks should keep the Schatz better supported and the Bund curve with a
steepening bias also as US headwinds extend.

The backdrop for EGB spreads remains choppy as tangible official colour on the planned TPM
instrument seems unlikely near-term with headline risks still stemming from sources. Hawkish
rates talk (see Overnight News) could put the latest BTP-Bund spread tightening to the test
again. 10y Greece continued to underperform on Friday as upgrade hopes did not materialise
and the PDMA announced another auction for today (see below).

Today's Eurogroup meeting could provide relative support for spreads as finance ministers may
signal further fiscal support in case of economic hardship on a worsening energy crisis when
discussing the budgetary situation in the euro area.

Supply: EU syndication, KFW update, moderate EGB volume, decent
backflows

The EGB auction volume should moderate to about €16.5bn this week (vs. €25bn last week).

Germany is scheduled to tap its Schatz tomorrow and 30y Bund on Wednesday while the
Netherlands will be active in its 10y DSL. In the periphery, Greece will tap its 10y GGB Jun32
today and Italy will get active in 3y/7y/15y BTPs. Portugal, however, decided to stay put.

Decent €30.5bn redemption and coupon payments keep net supply in negative territory. The
backflows from the Netherlands (€16.6) and Italy (€13.9bn) will be available for reinvestment
from Wednesday (considering t+2 settlement).

forecast

Source: DMOs, Bloomberg, Commerzbank Research

At the start of the week, SSAs will be in focus. The EU should kick-start its H2 funding with
a NGEU syndication. The NGEU funding target for H2 is €50bn (same as in H1), and given
four auctions and five syndications, the size of the upcoming transaction should be around
€8bn. MFA/SURE funding could boost total H2 issuance to €65.6bn and should lead to larger
syndications after the summer break.

The KFW mid-year funding update will also be in focus. There is uncertainty with potential
upside risk for the funding given the government's several new bailout and relief packages for
the energy sector which should partly be paid out via KFW.

It remains unclear whether the initiatives are only backed by Federal guarantees or also involve
Bund funding similar to the economic support measures during the corona crisis. Either way, as
most measures appear to imply credit lines rather than swift payouts of the full amounts as well
as a temporary and thus short-term character, we expect limited impact on KFW bond funding
and spreads. Even in case of an upward revision, the funding progress should cushion any
adverse impact on spreads. The current KFW bond funding target for 2022 foresees a €80-85bn
range of which €64bn (i.e. 75%) are already funded.
