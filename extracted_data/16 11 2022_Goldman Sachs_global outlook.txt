Global growth slowed through 2022 on a diminishing reopening boost, ﬁscal and
n

monetary tightening, China’s Covid restrictions and property slump, and the
Russia-Ukraine war.  We expect global growth of just 1.8% in 2023, as US
resilience contrasts with a European recession and a bumpy reopening in China.

The US should narrowly avoid recession as core PCE inﬂation slows from 5%
n

now to 3% in late 2023 with a ½pp rise in the unemployment rate.  To keep

growth below potential amidst stronger real income growth, we now see the
Fed hiking another 125bp to a peak of 5-5.25%.  We don’t expect cuts in 2023.

How can core inﬂation fall so much with such a small employment hit?  The
n

reason, we think, is that this cycle is different from prior high-inﬂation periods.
First, post-pandemic labor market overheating showed up not in excessive
employment but in unprecedented job openings, which are much less painful to
unwind.  Second, the disinﬂationary impact of the recent normalization in supply
chains and rental housing markets still has a long way to go.  And third,
long-term inﬂation expectations remain well-anchored.

The Euro area and the UK are probably in recession, mainly because of the real
n

income hit from surging energy bills.  But we expect only a mild downturn as
Europe has already managed to cut Russian gas imports without crushing
activity and is likely to beneﬁt from the same post-pandemic improvements that
are helping avoid US recession.  Given reduced risks of a deep downturn and
persistent inﬂation, we now expect hikes through May with a 3% ECB peak.

China is likely to grow slowly in H1 as an April reopening initially triggers an
n

increase in Covid cases that keeps caution high, but should accelerate sharply in
H2 on a reopening boost.  Our longer-run China view remains cautious because
of the long slide in the property market as well as slower potential growth
(reﬂecting weakness in both demographics and productivity).

Several central banks in Central/Eastern Europe and Latin America started hiking
n

rates well before their DM peers.  While none has clearly achieved a soft landing
yet, activity has been resilient and inﬂation is now coming down in some
countries, especially Brazil.  CEE is in a more difﬁcult position because of its
commodity exposure, high inﬂation, and ongoing monetary tightening.

Macro Outlook 2023: This Cycle Is Different 

Global growth slowed sharply through 2022 on a diminishing reopening boost, ﬁscal and 
monetary tightening, China’s ongoing Covid restrictions and property slump, and the 
energy supply shock resulting from the Russia-Ukraine war.  We expect the world to 
continue growing at a below-trend pace of 1.8% in 2023, with a mild recession in 
Europe and a bumpy reopening in China but also important pockets of resilience in the 
US and some EM early hikers, such as Brazil.

US Likely to Avoid Recession 
In the past year, US growth has slowed to a below-potential pace of about 1% because 
of a diminishing reopening boost, declining real disposable income (driven by ﬁscal 
normalization and high inﬂation), and aggressive monetary tightening.  In our forecast, 
growth remains at roughly this pace in 2023.  Unlike a year ago, when our forecast for 
both 2022 and 2023 was below consensus because we expected a negative impact of 
monetary and especially ﬁscal tightening, our current 2023 forecast is well above 
consensus (Exhibit 2).   

Our disagreement with the consensus is even more visible when we focus on recession 
probabilities.  As shown in Exhibit 3, we estimate a 35% probability that the US 
economy enters recession over the next 12 months, well below the median of 65% 
among the forecasters in the latest Wall Street Journal survey and toward the bottom of 
the range.

Why is our recession probability—while more than twice as high as the unconditional 
probability of entering recession in any given 12-month period—still clearly below 50%? 
One immediate reason is that the incoming activity data are nowhere close to 
recessionary.  The advance GDP report showed 2.6% (annualized) growth in Q3, 
nonfarm payrolls grew 261k in October, and there were 225k initial jobless claims in the 
week of November 5.  

More fundamentally, there are strong reasons to expect positive growth in coming 
quarters.  To be sure, the tightening in ﬁnancial conditions is weighing heavily on 
growth, to the tune of nearly 2pp at present.  But real disposable personal income is 
rebounding from the plunge seen in H1—when ﬁscal tightening and sharply higher 
inﬂation took their toll—to a pace of 3%+over the next year (Exhibit 4).  And while there 
are risks on both sides, we think the real income upturn is likely to be the stronger force 
as we move through 2023, especially because the ﬁnancial conditions drag will likely 
diminish assuming Fed ofﬁcials do not deliver dramatically more tightening than the 
rates market is currently pricing.

But the most fundamental question is this: how can the Fed bring down inﬂation by 2 
percentage points over the next year with only a ½pp increase in the unemployment 
rate (Exhibit 5)?  Doesn’t this ﬂy in the face of the experience from prior high-inﬂation 
episodes—most notably the 1970s—that ended with a much bigger increase in 
unemployment? 

Our answer is that this cycle is different from prior high-inﬂation periods.  

The ﬁrst reason why this cycle is different is that post-pandemic labor market 
overheating showed up not in excessive employment but in unprecedented job 
openings.  As shown in Exhibit 6, job openings surged in 2020-2021 as employers 
sought to keep up with the strongest economic recovery on record amidst continuing 
Covid fears and exceptionally generous unemployment beneﬁts.  However, employment 
as a share of the labor force only rose to roughly the pre-pandemic level, not above.

US Labor Demand

Now, however, the environment looks very different.  Demand has slowed, the 
pandemic has subsided, unemployment beneﬁts have normalized, and excess savings 
are coming down.  It is therefore not surprising that job openings and our jobs-workers 
gap—total labor demand minus total labor supply—are coming down quickly.  Based on 
timely job openings measures from Linkup and Indeed, we estimate that the 
jobs-workers gap has declined from a peak of nearly 6 million to just over 4 million, 
nearly half of the way to the 2mn level required to slow wage growth to a rate 
compatible with the inﬂation target (Exhibit 7, left panel).  Partly because of the 
reduction in the jobs-workers gap, timely measures of nominal wage growth, i.e. 
composition-adjusted average hourly earnings and our monthly wage survey composite, 

have slowed to levels consistent with 4½% wage growth (Exhibit 7, right panel).

The second reason why this cycle is different is that the recent normalization in supply 
chains and rental housing markets is a source of disinﬂation not seen in previous 
high-inﬂation episodes such as the 1970s, and it is only beginning to show up in the 
ofﬁcial numbers (Exhibit 8).  On the goods side, the ongoing rotation from goods to 
services spending, healing supply chains, and rebounding inventory levels should put 
downward pressure on core goods prices.  On the services side, asking rents on new 
leases have decelerated sharply after the one-time jump in rents related to the work 
from home-related increase in demand for space.  The October CPI report suggests that 
the lagging measure of sequential monthly ofﬁcial CPI shelter inﬂation—which captures 
both new and continuing leases—has likely peaked too.  Although year-on-year shelter 
inﬂation will likely rise through next spring as rents on continuing leases catch up to 
higher market rates, it is set to slow thereafter.

The third reason is that long-term inﬂation expectations remain well-anchored, especially 
relative to the 1970s.  This is true for each of the available measures, namely those 
based on 1) surveys of households, 2) surveys of economic forecasters, and 3) 
inﬂation-protected bonds.  Measures of short-term inﬂation expectations remain 
relatively high, but much of this probably reﬂects the spike in commodity prices and 
should wane if commodity prices level off.  The fact that inﬂation has only been high for 
a short and unusual pandemic period also suggests that elevated inﬂation is not 
entrenched (Exhibit 9). 

Taken together, we expect year-over-year core PCE inﬂation to decline from 5.1% in 
September to 2.9% in December 2023  (Exhibit 10).  We expect supply-constrained 
durable goods with still elevated margins, such as used cars, to drive nearly half of 
the slowdown in overall core inﬂation.

One might assume that our relatively optimistic inﬂation forecast translates into a 
relatively dovish Fed call.  But that assumption would be wrong.  The reason comes 
back to the interplay between real income and ﬁnancial conditions.  As real income 
recovers, a negative FCI growth impulse is required to keep growth below potential and 
continue rebalancing the labor market.  However, the negative FCI impulse on 
sequential growth will likely diminish from its current drag of around 2pp annualized 
because it depends on the change in, rather than the level of, ﬁnancial conditions 
(Exhibit 4, right panel).  As a result, and even under our relatively optimistic inﬂation 
forecast, additional rate hikes of at least as much as markets are now pricing are likely 
required to keep the labor market adjustment going.  Following the FCI easing over the 
past month, we now expect an additional 125bp of Fed rate hikes (vs. 100bp previously) 

with a downshift in the hiking pace to 50bp in December, and three smaller 25bp hikes 
in February, March, and now also May.  Our new 5-5.25% peak funds rate is modestly 
above market pricing (Exhibit 11).

With a resilient labor market and still elevated inﬂation, we don’t see any rate cuts in 
2023 unless the economy enters recession after all.  In our no-recession forecast, the 
Fed only implements a ﬁrst gentle 25bp cut in 2024Q2.  This baseline of “high rates for 
longer” would again illustrate how different this cycle is as the ﬁrst Fed cut in the 
median hiking cycle has historically come roughly six months after the last hike.

A Mild Recession in Europe 
In contrast to the US, the Euro area and the UK are probably in recession.  The reason 
for this is the much bigger and more drawn-out increase in household energy bills, 
which should boost headline inﬂation to peaks of 12% in the Euro area and 11% in the 
UK, far higher than in the US (Exhibit 12, left panel).  

In turn, high inﬂation is set to weigh on real income, consumption, and industrial 
production.  We forecast further declines in real income of 1½% in the Euro area 
through 2023Q1 and 3% in the UK through 2023Q2, before a pickup in H2 (Exhibit 12, 
right panel).  The plunge in timely and forward-looking surveys of gas-intensive European 
industries such as chemicals and metals also suggests that rising energy costs will 
lower production (Exhibit 13).  As a result, we look for cumulative declines in real GDP of 
0.7% in the Euro area (2022Q4-2023Q2) and 1.7% in the UK (2022Q3-2023Q2).

However, we don’t expect a deep European downturn, barring a very cold winter that 
imposes more severe energy rationing on the industrial sector in order to keep people 
warm in their homes. 

Already, Europe has cut Russian gas imports by 80% and total gas consumption by 
20-25% without crushing aggregate activity.  In fact, most of the hard economic data (as 
opposed to the surveys) continue to hold up remarkably well so far, with industrial 
production moving sideways, real GDP still up in the Euro area in Q3 (though down 

slightly in the UK), and labor markets holding up so far.

We think the reason for this resilience is that household energy savings and substitution 
to other energy sources have helped absorb the collapse in Russian gas imports.  Along 
with mild weather, these savings have boosted gas storage, reduced TTF gas prices by 
60% from their peak, and reduced downside risk from a very cold winter. 

Moreover, Europe is likely to beneﬁt from three similar post-pandemic sources of 
resilience that are helping the US avoid recession altogether.  First, Exhibit 14 shows 
that the rise in German production of chip-intensive items and cars—where pandemic 
bottlenecks are still easing—has approximately offset the ongoing decline in 
energy-intensive production.

Second, any decline in the household saving rate would support consumer spending, as 
happened in the US when real income plunged in early 2022.  Exhibit 15 points to room 
in Europe for saving rates to fall and for consumer credit growth to pick up (although 
likely by less than in the US because European lower-income households have relatively 
limited excess savings).  Third, while the bulk of reopening gains are behind us, Europe 
is still beneﬁting somewhat from a rebound in the service sector.   

While near-term risks of a deep recession have receded somewhat and our commodity 
strategists now look for a more limited rise in European gas prices next summer, we 
don’t expect GDP to rebound sharply in Europe once it exits a mild recession.  The main 
reason is that energy prices will likely stay high until sufﬁcient new energy supply and/or

major efﬁciency gains materialize.  Moreover, ﬁscal policy turns should turn into a drag 
from the second half of 2023 onwards.   

Incorporating both the resilience in incoming hard data and our less elevated path for 
gas prices, we have nudged up our Euro area 2023 growth forecast to -0.1% (from 
-0.4% previously).

What about European core inﬂation?  Although commodities drove the initial headline 
surge, price pressures have broadened signiﬁcantly across core categories in both the 
Euro area and the UK following upside inﬂation surprises (Exhibit 16, left panel).  In fact, 
UK core price pressures are now the broadest across the G10, with a perfect storm of 
an energy crisis (like continental Europe) and an overheated labor market (like the US).  

Given this strong momentum, we expect Euro area core inﬂation to edge up further to a 
peak of 5.3% year-over-year in December, before gradually declining to just above 3% 
by end-2023 on goods disinﬂation.  In the UK, we think that core inﬂation is peaking 
right around now and will also decline to 3% by end-2023.  

Given reduced risks of deep recession and persistent inﬂationary pressures, we now 
expect the ECB to hike through May with an additional 150bp of rate hikes to a peak 
deposit rate of 3% (vs. 2.75% previously).  Along with the reduction in near-term 
headline inﬂation pressures from gas prices, the emphasis on substantial rate hikes so 
far increases our conviction that the ECB will step down the pace to 50bp in December, 
in parallel with the Fed.  We maintain our forecast for a second 50bp hike in February 
but, given the ﬁrmer demand outlook, now look for two additional smaller 25bp hikes at 
the March and May meetings.  The risks around our peak 3% ECB rate are two-sided, 
with upside risk from potentially more persistent core inﬂation and downside risk from 
a deeper recession or a possible ﬂare-up in sovereign risk in Italy.  Given the tight labor 
market, high wage pressures, and ﬁrm inﬂation, we expect the BoE to hike Bank Rate 
by an additional 150bp to a terminal rate of 4.5%.

China’s Bumpy Reopening 
Our 2023 China outlook is a story of two halves with slow growth in the ﬁrst half 
followed by a more pronounced rebound in the second half as the economy reopens 
(Exhibit 17).  

We expect weak growth in Q4 and Q1 as the Zero Covid Policy (ZCP) likely stays in 
place during the winter.  In fact, the recent sharp rise in cases led us to have a 
signiﬁcantly below-consensus Q4 estimate of 1.2% annualized.

Although the leadership has clearly signaled that it aims to exit ZCP, we do not expect 
actual reopening to start until April.  The basic reason for this is that medical and 
communication preparations will take time.  Less than 70% of the 60+ age group in 
Mainland China are triple-vaccinated (Exhibit 18), and data from Hong Kong show that 
the unvaccinated elderly remain at serious risk of severe outcomes.  As a result, China 
will need to signiﬁcantly ramp up its vaccination pace from the current 100k/day before 
reopening can safely begin.   

16 November 2022

Goldman Sachs
Global Economics Analyst
Despite our April reopening baseline, we forecast Q2 growth of just 2% annualized on 
our assumption that reopening initially triggers an increase in infections that keeps 
caution high.  Weak growth in East Asian economies such as South Korea, Taiwan, and 
Hong Kong during the ﬁrst quarter of exiting ZCP also supports our soft Q2 forecast.   

In contrast, we look for a meaningful reopening growth boost in H2, which will likely 
extend into 2024.  As ZCP is currently still subtracting about 4-5% from the level of 
GDP, we see substantial room for a cyclical rebound as immunity levels rise and most 
households learn to live with the virus.   

Although clearly above consensus, our Q3 and Q4 forecasts of 10% and 6% annualized 
are not spectacular relative to other international reopening experiences.  This is 
because we expect a continued drag from Covid caution as well as other headwinds, 
some cyclical and some more structural.  

On the cyclical side, ﬁscal policy is set to tighten if the domestic economy rebounds, 
and China’s pandemic-related export boom should fade as global demand for tech, 
housing, and Covid-related products slows further.  

On the structural side, we see the contraction of the property sector and US chip export 
restrictions as multi-year drags.  We estimate that the ongoing slide of the property 
sector will subtract around -1½pp from growth next year as it continues to delever and 
face demographic headwinds (Exhibit 19).

We recently also estimated that the new US restrictions on exports of advanced chips 
(and the equipment and software to produce them) to China will subtract about ¼pp 
from China growth next year and 1.7% from the 2026 level of GDP, assuming US 
policymakers are serious about implementation.  This reﬂects reduced production in 
China of both chips and goods using advanced chips, such as smartphones and 
computers.  

The relatively muted rebound in aggregate demand—coupled with the relatively limited 
rise in inﬂation during reopening in other Asian economies—also drives our benign 
forecast for 2023 inﬂation and monetary policy.  Speciﬁcally, we expect core CPI to pick 
up only slightly from 0.7% to 1.2% next year, and the policy rate to stay ﬂat at just 2%.  

Although we do see a sharper reopening boost in 2023H2 and 2024H1 than other 
forecasters, our long-run China views remain structurally below consensus (Exhibit 20).  
We estimate that much of the slowdown in actual China growth in recent years 
corresponds to a slowdown in potential growth to only 4.2% in 2023.  We estimate that 
trend growth will slow further to just above 3% over the next decade on weakness in 
both demographics and productivity, and the long slide in the property market.

Pockets of Resilience in EM Early Hikers 

A number of economies in Latin America as well as Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) 
started hiking rates well before everyone else.  Among the nine EM early hikers, the 
policy rate has increased by an average of over 800bp (Exhibit 21, left panel) while our 
GS Financial Conditions Index (FCI) has tightened by an average of 450bp.1  Where are 
these economies headed and what can we learn from their experience for the broader 
global outlook? 

While no early hiker has clearly achieved a soft landing yet, activity has generally held 
up better than expected.  A majority of early hikers are probably still expanding, based 
on GDP growth, PMIs, and labor market indicators.  In particular, unemployment rates 
remain low in all economies, although they have edged up in several economies 
(Exhibit 21, right panel).2  We have found that elevated job openings, reopening, and 
strong private sector balance sheets—again unique characteristics of this different 
cycle—help explain this resilience. 

Encouragingly, sequential core inﬂation and wage growth have begun to moderate 
across most early hikers, although they remain very high.  The moderation in core 
inﬂation is most notable in Brazil, where we expect rate cuts to start in 2023Q2 and 
growth to pick up back to a potential-like pace of 2% in the second half of the year 
(Exhibit 22, left panel).   

In contrast, the CEE economies are in a more difﬁcult position.  This reﬂects CEE’s 
exposure to the surge in European gas prices, as well as continued high, broad, and in 
the cases of Hungary and Poland still-rising inﬂation.  We therefore expect the Czech 
and Polish central banks to resume their rate hike campaigns before long (Exhibit 22,

We deﬁne an “early hiker” as a country under our coverage that began to increase the policy rate by 

October 2021 with a cumulative increase in the ﬁrst six months of at least 100bp.

Our classiﬁcation suggests that Chile is likely in a mild recession, while the Czech Republic and Poland are 

close calls.

right panel), and look for moderate declines in GDP in most CEE economies. 

Overall, the resilience of activity in several EM early hikers so far supports our view that 
the current high-inﬂation period does not need to end in deep recession.   

Some Progress, But Still an Uncertain World 
The key economic question for 2023 is whether central banks will be able to bring down 
inﬂation to more acceptable levels without a recession, or at least without a deep 
recession.  We are reasonably optimistic, but there are substantial risks to our view. 

One risk is that inﬂation pressures simply remain pervasive enough that central banks 
have no choice but to keep tightening aggressively.  If so, a recession might become 
unavoidable, not just in Europe but also in the US.  The recent news ﬂow has reduced 
this risk slightly in the US, as the labor market continues to adjust and inﬂation has 
begun to slow.  But the picture is not uniform.  Central banks in Europe and those EM 
economies where inﬂation is still increasing may be forced into further tightening in an 
environment of exchange rate depreciation and rising inﬂation expectations. 

The other main risk is that underlying inﬂation does come down, but central banks are 
late in recognizing the improvement because they are too focused on lagging indicators 
of inﬂation such as CPI shelter inﬂation.  In the US, we have recently become a little less 
concerned about this risk as well.  Fed ofﬁcials have made it clear that they are not 
exclusively focused on the CPI rent numbers but also on more leading indicators such 
as asking rents on new leases, which have slowed sharply in recent months.  Moreover, 
many central banks have either already slowed their hiking pace or signaled that they 
will do so soon.  This reduces the risk of overtightening as it will allow for more time to 
assess the impact of higher rates on the economy. 

Beyond the core inﬂation dynamic, we remain concerned about political and geopolitical

shocks, which could affect the global economy via higher uncertainty, tighter ﬁnancial 
conditions, or negative effects on commodity supply.  Some of these risks have 
diminished slightly as well.  The Italian, Brazilian, and US midterm elections have come 
and gone without major market disruptions.  Spreads on Italian government debt have 
diminished, Brazil may be headed toward a soft landing, and there is even a possibility 
that the US debt limit—arguably the biggest potential source of market disruption 
emanating from DC in 2023—will be resolved in the “lame-duck” session of Congress 
between now and year-end 2022.  Moreover, the latest meeting between Presidents 
Biden and Xi promises to defuse at least some of the tensions between the US and 
China, which might also help to achieve a negotiated solution to the Russia-Ukraine war.  

But there are still plenty of risks that could return us to the exceptionally volatile 
environment of the ﬁrst half of 2022.  So far, a settlement in the Russia-Ukraine war 
does not seem close at hand, and the impact of the price cap on Russian oil is 
uncertain.  The political instability in the Middle East—while far from a new feature of 
the geopolitical order—also has the potential to deal another blow to energy markets at 
a time when the supply-demand balance is already precarious.  Thus, our cautiously 
optimistic global economic outlook remains fraught with substantial risks.

illegal. It does not constitute a personal recommendation or take into account the particular investment objectives, ﬁnancial situations, or needs of
