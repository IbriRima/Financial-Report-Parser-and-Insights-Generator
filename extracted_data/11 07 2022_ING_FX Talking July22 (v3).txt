How low  

Can you go?

How low can you go? 

Given fears of a global recession, ‘How low can you go?’ is now a pressing question being 
asked of many risk assets and of key FX pairs like EUR/USD. Investors hold out little hope 

for improvement in energy supplies anytime soon and central bankers are showing no 
signs of being distracted from forceful monetary tightening cycles. That all points to 

equity markets perhaps another 10% lower and a worst case for EUR/USD near 0.95. 

The ECB in particular faces the conundrum of trying to address inflation fears, while at 

the same time trying to avoid driving the Eurozone economy into recession. While it 
may only deliver 100bp of the 175bp tightening currently priced by the market, our 

team now look for a Eurozone technical recession in 4Q22/1Q23. This will weigh on pro-

cyclical currencies like the euro, sterling, the Swedish krona, and many currencies in CEE. 

Outperformers in what will be a difficult summer for risk will likely remain the dollar, the 

yen and the Swiss franc. In fact, the Swiss National Bank is now using its huge war chest 

of FX reserves to ensure the franc does just that – strengthen. 

Peak pain this summer and the focus on demand destruction will keep commodity 

currencies on the back foot. Most vulnerable may well be the likes of the South African 

rand and the Brazilian real – the latter shaping up for contentious elections in October. 

And in Asia, high beta currencies like the Korean won will remain soft as will the 
Philippine peso and Indonesian rupiah, the latter pair left vulnerable by dovish central 

banks. USD/CNY set to remain range-bound while Covid policy and geopolitics dominate.

EUR/USD 

How low can you go? 
 
Current spot: 1.0133 

 

 • As we put pen to paper, EUR/USD is within striking distance of 

parity. The stagflationary effects of the war in Ukraine are being 
felt far more in Europe than in N. America. Thus, short term rate 
spreads continue to move against EUR/USD as does the risk 
environment, where equities could have another 10% leg lower.  

• Based on recent correlations, a 10% fall in equities and a 25bp 

widening in spreads this summer would put EUR/USD somewhere 
near 0.98. A 50bp widening in spreads, were the Fed to move 
more aggressively or ECB hawks to soften, would be worth 0.95. 

• Don’t look for a substantial turn higher in EUR/USD this summer, 

since it seems far too early for Fed hawks to back down.

USD/JPY 

Deteriorating risk sentiment to support the JPY 
 
Current spot: 136.97 

 

 • One of the core challenges faced by central banks the world over 

is to get inflation lower. The only tool they have at their disposal 
is to tighten monetary conditions and try to slow demand. 
Slowing demand is taking its toll on equity markets, which look 
vulnerable as central banks tighten further even as growth slows. 
The JPY, like the USD and CHF, should out-perform this summer. 

• The big USD/JPY rally looks to have stalled near 135 and certainly 

the going above here will be harder. US 10-year yields, a key 
driver of USD/JPY, have probably peaked at 3.50%. 

• The BoJ meeting of July 21st is unlikely to see the BoJ turn 

hawkish. A lower USD/JPY will be driven by equities & US yields.

GBP/USD 

Bank of England keeping a close eye on sterling 
 
Current spot: 1.1971 

 

 • Away from the political circus in Westminster, sterling has been 

hit by the super-strong dollar, but is outperforming the euro. Here 
the BoE has started to highlight sterling’s role in monetary 
conditions. With UK CPI expected to push up to 11% in October, 
expect the BoE to stay hawkish and to hike 50bp on August 4th. 

• Yet, as a growth-sensitive currency, sterling will be in a for a 

tough summer and Cable looks set to trade down to 1.17 and 
possibly 1.14/15 again. We tentatively think these could again 
prove the lows for the year if, as we expect the $ turns by yr-end. 

• UK politics mean we won’t have a working government until 

September, but looser fiscal policy this Autumn can help GBP.

EUR/JPY 

The worst of both worlds 
 
Current spot: 138.79 

 

 • EUR/JPY is being hit by the double-whammy of European 

stagflation and the global bear market in equities. On the former 
the focus is very much on natural gas and whether the likes of 
Germany are completely cut off from Russian supplies. Such an 
outcome would cement already strong fears of German and 
eurozone recession. We see a technical recession in 4Q22/1Q23. 

• For the ECB, the challenge will be to threaten even more hawkish 

policy – even as Eurozone growth fears sink the euro. We think 
ECB can only deliver 100bp of the 175bp tightening priced. 

• A long hot summer for risk should see JPY in demand. A short 

squeeze in JPY & fresh shorts in EUR could see EUR/JPY trade 132.

EUR/GBP 

BoE can prevent a worst case outcome 
 
Current spot: 0.8465 

 

 • The energy surge has hit both the UK and the Eurozone equally 

(terms of trade losses), but GBP looks to be outperforming on the 
back of a more hawkish BoE. Unlike in May when the last BoE 
inflation report was released, the BoE in August might embrace 
the tightening expectations priced into the market as a means to 
keep GBP supported. Who wants a weaker currency right now?  

• EUR/GBP has outside risk to the 0.8300 area – should EUR/USD’s 

break of 1.00 generate fireworks. But a difficult risk environment 
this summer should send EUR/GBP back up to 0.85/86. 

• Wild card: will the new UK PM being any less hostile to Brussels 

and could that help GBP? We should find out in September.

EUR/CHF 

No messing around from the SNB 
 
Current spot: 0.9929 

 

 • Last month the SNB ripped up its prior script, hiked 50bp and 

implied it could be intervening in FX markets to strengthen the 
CHF. We had warned of that risk last month - in that the SNB 
wanted the real trade-weighted CHF to remain stable. Because of 
low Swiss inflation compared to trading partners, a stable real 
CHF now requires a stronger nominal CHF.   

• In practise this may mean the SNB wants EUR/CHF 4-5% lower on 

the year – perhaps lower were USD/CHF to break above 1.00. 

• No longer is the CHF ‘highly valued’. Expect another large rate 

hike from the SNB in September (perhaps 75bp if the ECB has 
done 75bp by then?) and EUR/CHF to remain offered throughout.

EUR/NOK 

It’s going to take some time for NOK to recover 
 
Current spot: 10.30 

 

 • NOK has remained weak as its relatively low liquidity makes it 

vulnerable to global risk sentiment deterioration. The recent woes 
in the oil market are another reason for concern. 

• We think some more weakness over the coming weeks is 

possible, but the outlook for the latter part of the year and 2023 
remains rather constructive, thanks to an attractive rate profile 
(NB to tighten by 100bp more by year-end) and good exposure 
to higher energy prices and increased demand for exports.  

• In our view, there is some room for a return below 10.00 in 

EUR/NOK by the end of the year, but that will mostly depend on a 
stabilisation/recovery in global risk assets.

EUR/SEK 

Riksbank’s fast tightening can’t help SEK now 
 
Current spot: 10.72 

 

 • Following the recent hawkish shift, we expect the Riksbank to 

deliver another 50bp rate hike in September, followed by 25bp in 
November.  

• A hawkish Riksbank may still fail to lift the krona, which is 

negatively exposed to the global (and especially European) 
economic woes and risk-off environment. 

• In the near term, we may well see a spike above 10.80 in 

EUR/SEK, but there could be room for a return to the 10.50-10.60 
area by the end of 3Q. A stabilisation in risk sentiment in 4Q may 
help EUR/SEK reconnect with a deeply negative rate differential 
and bring EUR/SEK close to 10.20-10.40.

EUR/DKK 

Denmark eyeing the end of negative rates 
 
Current spot: 7.4414 

 

 • Denmark’s National Bank stuck with zero FX interventions in June, 

and EUR/DKK has continued to hover around the 7.4400 mark 
without signs of the peg coming under pressure. 

• We expect 100bp of tightening by the ECB before the end of the 

year, and currently see no reasons for the DN to diverge 
significantly from this pattern. This means that Denmark looks 
set to exit negative rates for the first time since 2014 by this fall.  

• We believe that any fresh pressure on EUR/DKK should be 

countered predominantly with FX interventions, and an 
intentional further widening of the EUR-DKK short-term rate 
differential may only be a last-resort move.

USD/CAD 

A bit more pain before a CAD rebound 
 
Current spot: 1.2991 

 

 • We still think that among G10 commodity currencies, CAD 

remains the least vulnerable. As markets trade increasingly in 
line with recession fears, North America’s lower exposure to 
global headwinds is good news for CAD. The commodity story 
should also offer some help, barring another oil correction. 

• This doesn’t mean that there are no upside risks to USD/CAD: 

unstable risk sentiment and USD strength may remain themes 
for the short-term. A temporary spike to 1.31-1.33 is possible, but 
strong fundamentals suggest CAD will rebound fiercely once 
sentiment stabilises. 

• The Bank of Canada’s steep tightening path (we expect a 75bp 

hike in July) may pay dividends for CAD in the medium term.

AUD/USD 

Short-term downside risks persist 
 
Current spot: 0.6812 

 

 • The RBA surprised on the hawkish side with a 50bp rate hike, but 

the FX impact of monetary policy has been negligible, and this 
should continue to be the case throughout a summer of hikes. 

• AUD should continue to be driven almost solely by external 

drivers. Uncertainty around China’s outlook remains elevated 
despite recent stimulus from Beijing, and potential fresh curbs on 
steel production could increase downside risks for iron ore prices.  

• Still, the AUD/USD short-term outlook should remain mostly a 

function of global risk sentiment dynamics and USD swings. We 
could see a slip to 0.66-0.67 in the coming weeks, but are sticking 
with an upward-sloping forecast profile for year-end - in line with 
other high-beta currency pairs.

NZD/USD 

RBNZ considering a dovish rethink? 
 
Current spot: 0.6166 

 

 • The RBNZ should hike by another 50bp in July, in line with latest 

projections and market expectations. However, New Zealand’s 
housing market dropped by the most since 2009 in 2Q22 (-2.3% 
QoQ) and there are multiple signs – especially on the consumer 
side – that the economy is slowing significantly.  

• We think there is an increasing risk of the RBNZ having to review 

its rate profile lower in August, or anyway by the end of the year. 

• That can have an impact on AUD/NZD, making a sustainable 

return to sub-1.10 levels less likely. But when it comes to 
NZD/USD, it’s still all about global factors, and a drop below 
0.6000 in the near term surely can’t be excluded.

EUR/PLN 

NBP underdelivers in tightening in July, PLN at risk. 
 
Current spot: 4.7865 

 

 • NBP failed to meet expectations and hiked rates by 50bp in July 

instead of 75bp. While we still expect the MPC to gradually move 
the reference rate to 8.5%, market bets for future hikes have 
diminished. The unsupportive external environment (likely 
recession in Europe, strong dollar) puts the zloty at risk. We don’t 
consider EUR/PLN moving back to 5 (its peak after the Russian 
invasion shock) as a baseline scenario, but certainly possible. 

• Longer term prospects are largely muted, as the deterioration of 

Poland’s external balance largely offsets NBP rate hikes. EUR/PLN 
moving to 4.60 would require both a significant improvement in 
CEE sentiment and further NBP policy tightening.

EUR/HUF 

Forint remains in the grip of external factors 
 
Current spot: 407.51 

 

 • EUR/HUF reached a new high at 417 in July, keeping the central 

bank busy. With several decisive steps, it raised the effective 
interest rate to 9.75%. 

• The government has also stepped up to the plate, sending 

messages resonating well with nervous markets. With some 
positive comments on the Rule of Law debate and energy supply 
security, EUR/HUF moved to the vicinity of 400.  

• We continue to watch headlines from Brussels signalling a 

turnaround in the EU funds dispute that should unlock the hidden 
potential of the forint. A second round of recovery could be 
fuelled by the CEE’s highest positive real interest rate in 1H23.

EUR/CZK 

CNB determined to further defend koruna 
 
Current spot: 24.65 

 

 • Czech National Bank continues FX intervention and keeps the 

koruna close to EUR 24.75/CZK. Based on our calculations, the 
central bank has sold roughly EUR9bn since the beginning of 
May, equivalent to 5.8% of FX reserves at the end of April.  

• At the same time, FX interventions are becoming more costly, 

suggesting that the situation will become more complicated for 
the CNB. Although the CNB has some of the largest FX reserves 
relative to GDP in the world, the nominal volume is not that large.  

• However, this looks more of an issue for the fourth quarter. Until 

then, we expect no change in the current situation. Testing the 
CNB’s resolve will not give investors enough reward for the 
expensive cost in shorting the koruna.

EUR/RON 

Untouchable threshold 
 
Current spot: 4.9441 

 

 • The NBR recently raised the key rate by 100bp to 4.75% in 

response to rising inflation, which we expect to exceed 15% in 
June.  

• This leaves Romania with the most negative real rates not only in 

the region but almost in the entire EM space. Catching up with 
peers in the region is very likely to demand further rate hikes and 
the pace of moves may continue to accelerate. 

• We continue to expect the NBR to hold EUR/RON below 4.95 until 

at least the end of this year. Moreover, inflationary pressures are 
rising, which should strengthen the central bank's resolve to keep 
FX stable given the large FX passthrough to inflation in Romania.

EUR/HRK 

One step closer to the euro world 
 
Current spot: 7.5175 

 

 • At the end of June, the European Union summit approved the 

introduction of the euro in Croatia. The country will become the 
20th member of the euro area from January 2023. The use of the 
euro in Croatia will be formally confirmed in July by finance 
ministers. 

• The report was followed by Moody's announcement of a possible 

two-notch upgrade to Baa2 in the event of a positive outcome of 
the EU negotiations. 

• The FX rate at which euro adoption will take place will likely be 

very close to the 7.5345 central parity rate at which Croatia was 
included in the ERM-II. 

• Due to the likely approval of euro adoption, we will cease 

coverage of HRK in FX Talking from the next issue.

EUR/RSD 

Concerted effort to minimise inflationary pressures 
 
Current spot: 117.35 

 

 • The NBS raised the key rate by 25bp to 2.75% in July, 

disappointing market expectations. In a statement, the bank said 
it wanted to continue to fight inflation but at the same time it 
had to take into account the growth of the economy. At the 
same time, the central bank said that stable FX limits the pass-
through to import prices and limits further inflation. 

• The dinar has moved slightly below 117.50 since the beginning of 

June but remains stable and we expect this to continue with a 
possible further very gradual slide lower to coordinate interest 
rate and FX tools in an effort to minimize inflationary pressures.

 • Given the paralyzed capital account, ruble performance is 

becoming more volatile intra-month, with a strong 2nd half of the 
month during tax periods and sharp depreciations afterwards. 

• Gazprom’s refusal to pay RUB1,2 tr ($20 bn) dividend limits the 

scope for RUB appreciation in summer, but the government’s 
decision to boost taxation on GAZP by RUB400 bn per month in 
Sep-Nov suggests that demand for RUB is merely postponed. 

• With a current account surplus of $20-30bn per month, RUB is 

likely to tend to appreciate, but this should be offset by the 
recent decision to allow non-repatriation of FX export proceeds 
and possible restart of FX purchases in alternative FX (CNY?) – 
meaning a more even RUB performance in the medium term.

USD/UAH 

NBU continues to defend the hryvnia 
 
Current spot: 29.52 

 

 • NBU policy and currency restrictions remain the driving force for 

the hryvnia. This is unlikely to change as long as the Russian 
aggression continues. Recent monetary tightening by the central 
bank confirms FX stabilization should remain a major tool for 
combating high inflation.    

• With no end to the conflict in sight, USD/UAH is likely to remain 

close to current levels at least until the end of the year. We still 
see scope for gains in the longer term, largely driven by the 
inflow of capital for reconstruction, likely funded to a large extent 
by seized Russian assets worldwide. According to Prime Minister 
Denys Shmyhal a recovery may cost up to US$750bn. A fraction 
of this should suffice to drive USD/UAH lower, provided the war 
subsides or even stops.

USD/KZT 

Geopolitical risks are materializing 
 
Current spot: 465.11 

 

 • The Tenge showed weakness in June-July, in line with our base 

case, due to deterioration of Kazakhstan-Russia relations, the 
souring mood on global commodity markets, and the dividend 
season adding to the local pressure. 

• Full suspension of CPC’s oil transit (80% of annual oil exports) will 

cut Kazakhstan’s monthly oil export proceeds by $4-4.3 bn from 
$5.0-5.4 bn under an average Brent price of $110-120/bbl. 
Potential rerouting could limit losses to $2.0-2.5 bn/month. 

• Geopolitical tensions with Russia and risk of global recession 

should keep the tenge in 450-500 range. Presidential efforts to 
develop trade with USA, EU, and China along with diversification 
of trade routes are strategically positive.

USD/TRY 

Regulatory activity supports TRY 
 
Current spot: 17.32 

 

 • Policy makers, trying to replicate some parts of the monetary 

transmission mechanism, have introduced a number of 
measures since late April. With these moves, short-term TRY 
pressure can ease. However, sustaining stability, managing 
disinflation and restoring reserves in the current environment 
require application of more conventional policy tools, in our view.   

• We have seen relative TRY strength against the USD on the back 

of recent measures, particularly the regulation which restricts 
access to TRY loans for firms with FX cash buffers recently.  

• Whether this performance is sustained will be determined by not 

only the global backdrop given recent pressures on lira with risk-
off mode in global financial markets but also inflation 
expectations in an environment of negative real rates.

USD/ZAR 

Perfect storm for EM commodity currencies 
 
Current spot: 16.92 

 

 • June proved the perfect storm for the EM commodity complex, 

where higher US rates met a growing conviction that demand 
destruction would mean lower commodity prices after all. As in 
Brazil, South Africa’s terms of trade are now down YTD – wiping 
out all of the March spike. 

• As a big high beta EM currency, we think the ZAR can fall further 

this summer – with outside risk in USD/ZAR to the 18 area. We are 
worried that Fed tightening pushes equities down another 10%. 

• SARB hiked 50bp in May to 4.75%. But this looks quite low relative 

to 6.5% CPI and the market expects further rate hikes to 6.00% 
by year-end. We suspect ZAR weakness prompts larger hikes.

USD/ILS 

BoI probably wants a stronger Shekel 
 
Current spot: 3.4843 

 

 • $/ILS recently hit 3.50, helped by the stronger dollar and the 

under-performance of the tech ‘growth’ industry. The BoI uses FX 
management quite actively to support monetary policy and we 
suspect the shekel is too weak for it. We wonder whether the BoI, 
like the SNB, will want to use its large FX reserves to drive $/ILS 
lower to tighten monetary conditions? 

• Last month the BoI accelerated its hiking cycle to a 50bp 

increment. But the policy rate is very low at just 1.25%. The 
market prices 2.50% by early next year – but BoI could do more.   

• Israeli growth at 5% this year will be the envy of the world. Tight 

labour markets suggest inflation will keep BoI hawkish all year.

USD/BRL 

Gearing up for contentious elections 
 
Current spot: 5.2551 

 

 • The real has fallen 10% over the last month as global recession 

fears hit home. Somewhat amazingly Brazil’s early year Terms of 
Trade gains have completely vanished as Soybeans, Oil and Iron 
Ore all turn lower. Unless we see some substantial stimulus from 
China to support industrial commodities, BRL looks vulnerable.  

• BACEN hiked rates 50bp last month to 13.25% and promised 

another 25-50bp in August. Inflation looks to be peaking here 
around 12% and could come lower with tax cuts.  

• Government pre-election give-aways have raised fiscal concerns 

and pushed the sovereign CDS through 300bp. A contentious 
election – US Capitol Hill-like riots? – to keep a risk premium in BRL

USD/MXN 

Banxico maintains 625bp spread and stable MXN 
 
Current spot: 20.54 

 

 • Consistent with its promise to deliver ‘more forceful tightening’, 

Banxico hiked 75bp in June and has left the door open for the 
same again in early August. No doubt it will see whether the Fed 
does 50bp or 75bp on July 27th and will copy that. Such a move 
will maintain the 625bp spread over Fed rates – which seems a 
sufficient spread to keep USD/MXN stable near 20.00/20.50. 

• Ratings agencies are liking what authorities are doing and S&P 

this month has shifted Mexico’s outlook to stable from negative. 
At BBB, S&P has Mexico 4 notches above Brazil. 

• A tricky summer for risk could see $/MXN briefly trade 21.00/50 

as equities stay pressured, but favour a return to 20.00 later.

USD/CLP 

Crash 
 
Current spot: 974.11 

 

 • Tighter US rates, a stronger dollar and most recently a collapse in 

copper prices have proved toxic for the Chilean peso. USD/CLP 
jumped 20% in a month! It seems that the central bank was not 
particularly active in fighting the move given that FX reserves 
stayed at $45bn in June. The Min Fin is promising new measures 
to support the CLP, but FX reserves aren’t particularly large. 

• Expect the central bank perhaps to re-assess the extent of its 

tightening cycle. The policy rate is at 9% after a 75bp hike in 
June. The policy rate may now need to go well above 10%. 

• Sep 4th sees the nation vote on a new constitution. A rejection 

could deliver unwelcome political uncertainty.

USD/CNY 

Short term upbeat 
 
Current spot: 6.7137 

 

 • The recovery of economic growth should put appreciation 

pressure on the yuan this month. But we should be aware that 
the risk of another lockdown still exists.  

• Activity data to be released on 15 July should be positive for the 

currency even though the GDP release for 2Q22 is expected to 
show a contraction in the quarter. 

• The economy and therefore the yuan face some headwinds 

further down the road. It is still uncertain if the US is going to lift 
tariffs on Chinese goods, or whether it will impose new tariffs or 
new regulations that deter imports of Chinese tech parts and 
products.

USD/INR 

Fighting a losing battle 
 
Current spot: 79.42 

 

 • Punctuated by occasional rallies, the passage of USD/INR since 

early 2021 has been steadily upwards, and for forecasting, the 
main concern has been timing the temporary rallies as the INR 
has moved higher.  

• Driving the depreciation is an inflation outlook that, while not 

much different currently to that in the US, seems likely to exceed 
it over the medium term. The RBI is stepping up its anti-inflation 
stance, but it is late to the game and may lack a little credibility. 

• Further rate hikes in the coming quarters are likely to be 50bp or 

bigger. Though some respite may be due as falling global 
agricultural prices could see inflation moderating.

USD/IDR 

IDR slides as investors dump bonds on rising inflation 
 
Current spot: 14972 

 

 • The IDR was on the defensive in June with the recent partial palm 

oil export ban cutting down the trade surplus from record highs.   
Hefty export receipts helped insulate the IDR early in 2022 but 
this support appears to be fading. 

• Bank Indonesia opted to keep policy rates untouched despite 

inflation moving past their target, citing subdued core inflation.  
Meanwhile, higher inflation and expectations for an eventual rate 
hike forced selling in the bond market, weighing on the IDR.  

• The IDR is likely to weaken further in the near term as BI remains 

dovish while inflation pressures mount.  Resumption of partial 
palm oil exports may mitigate the slide but IDR still likely to 
weaken in near term.

USD/KRW 

KRW to test the next resistance level of 1320 soon   
 
Current spot: 1304.65 

 

 • The KRW showed movements typical of a high beta currency last 

month and this downward pressure is expected to continue in 
the short-term as market expectations for a US recession grow. 

• The Bank of Korea will raise its repo rate 50bp at its 13 July 

meeting in response to higher-than-expected CPI inflation for 
June and rapidly soaring inflation expectations. But any 
differential over US rates will likely disappear when the Fed hikes 
75bp at the end of the month.   

• Solid global demand for IT and vessels (LNG tankers) is likely to 

support Korea’s exports in medium term. In financial markets, 
foreigners’ positioning in the equity market has become very 
light, so cash outflows are not likely to be as large as in the first 
half of this year.

continued to widen to new records.  Meanwhile, inflation zoomed 
past target to hit multi-year highs sparking some concern about 
near-term growth prospects.  

• PHP was also on the back foot given Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas’ 

(BSP) relatively dovish stance in the face of high inflation.  BSP 
hiked policy rates last June but opted for a measured 25bp 
increase compared to more hawkish tightening from global

Surging inflation could force inter-meeting MAS action 
 
Current spot: 1.4013

heightened concerns about a hawkish Fed rate hike cycle and 
slowing global growth projections.  

• Inflation continued to edge higher with both headline and core 

inflation readings accelerating to multi-year highs.  A sustained 
pickup in inflation could spark additional tightening from the 
Monetary Authority of Singapore even ahead of the scheduled 
October meeting. 

• The SGD is likely to face sustained pressure to weaken on a broad

recession fears.

USD/TWD 

Inflation risk lowered 
 
Current spot: 29.83 

 

 • Taiwan's economy should continue to be buoyed by strong sales 

of semiconductors in the medium term.  

• Inflation risks are set to subside as food prices are falling. 

Consequently, Taiwan’s central bank might not hike again in 
September. And even if they do hike, this will likely be a very 
small increase of 12.5bp.  

• There are media reports that Europe is trying to build its own 

semiconductor manufacturing hub. This should not be a threat to 
Taiwan anytime soon. But over the longer-term, supply of 
semiconductors could rise and eat into profit margins of Taiwan’s 
semiconductor manufacturers, undermining GDP.
