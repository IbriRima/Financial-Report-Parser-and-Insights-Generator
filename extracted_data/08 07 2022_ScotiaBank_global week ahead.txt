THE GLOBAL WEEK AHEAD 

 Ripping Off the Band-Aid  

Since some readers of this publication likely care about US inflation and the Bank of Canada my 

advice would be not to take Wednesday off! In fact, most of the week’s main events including 

the Q2 US earnings season unfold over the back half of the week. 

BANK OF CANADA—JUST RIP THE BAND-AID OFF?! 

The Bank of Canada delivers its latest policy rate statement on Wednesday (10amET) at the 

same time as it releases updated forecasts and assessments in its Monetary Policy Report. 

Governor Macklem and SDG Rogers hold a joint press conference one hour later. The suite of 

communications unfolds after the release of US CPI that may muddy the waters in terms of pure 

market reactions to the developments. 

A 75bps rate hike is expected alongside a continued pledge to be data dependent on a quest to 

return the 1.5% overnight rate toward the upper end of the 2–3% neutral rate range or above 

which is probably the guidance they will repeat. I think a policy rate at 3% by September and 50–

75bps higher than that into year-end is a reasonable view. Consensus is unanimous in expecting 

75bps this week and OIS markets are pricing half of another quarter point and hence straddling 

the line between 75 and 100bps.  

For the sake of the Bank of Canada’s 

remaining credibility it would be better advised 

for them to go 75bps now and then go another 

75bps in September to get up to 3% and hence 

push above the neutral rate range into suitably 

more restrictive territory than to more 

aggressively rip the band-aid off with a move of 

100bps now—or more. I would like to see the 

latter and think there is a strong case for 100+ 

because policy remains excessively stimulative 

with a policy rate 100bps below the mid-point 

of the neutral rate range and the balance sheet 

remains bloated even with no roll-off caps on 

maturing Government of Canada bond 

holdings. Yet inflation is four times the target 

rate and the BoC keeps chasing it higher with its forecasts. The problem is that after having 

guided ‘gradual and measured’ all along and after missing opportunities to hike earlier even 

when it was priced in January, for the BoC to now swing to the other side with a 100+ move 

now would only add to the sense it is behaving very erratically if not panicking. An extra 25 now 

would accomplish little over leaving the door open to another large move at the next meeting. 

Still, I can’t resist noting that the same folks who mocked my view some time ago that the BoC 

would be increasing the size of its rate hikes now suddenly seem to think it’s obvious they 

should do so. 

To support such expectations, start with tracking inflation. The BoC continues to play catch up 

to inflationary pressures. The last reading landed above consensus with headline CPI inflation 

rising to its highest since 1983 and with average core inflation hitting the highest on record 

(recap here). Chart 1 shows that Q2 inflation is sharply exceeding the BoC’s 5.8% y/y forecast 

with tracking at about 7¼% and this continues the weak track record at forecast inflation. 

Inflation expectations continue to move higher according to survey-based evidence across 

businesses (chart 2) and consumers (chart 3). Market-based implied measures have waned

coincidental to the sell-off in base yields (chart 

4). The BoC is likely to remain concerned about 

the risks around unmoored inflation 

expectations and determined to try to steer 

them lower. 

In addition to data, the Bank of Canada has also 

provided altered guidance in favour of a faster 

pace, potentially bigger individual moves and 

higher terminal rates. For instance, the June BoC 

statement omitted reference to “timing” to 

suggest rate hikes were likely to be compressed 

into a shorter period of time. The same 

statement added “more” in front of “forcefully” 

to drive home the point that they wish to move 

more quickly and/or in bigger increments. 

Deputy Governor Beaudry’s speech the day 

after that statement then said: 

“We see this aspect of potentially 

needing to go higher than we thought 

before and we still have the idea that 

we want to get there as quickly as 

possible so that could involve doing 

more moves in a row or it could involve 

bigger moves.”  

When SDG Rogers spoke a week later at a Globe 

and Mail event she passed on the opportunity to 

talk down a bigger 75bps hike.  

So to be clear, nothing the BoC has provided 

explicit guidance about the size of a rate hike 

beyond leaving the door open to perhaps doing 

something bigger than 50bps and at a quickened pace. 

There may be several considerations that could hold them back from a mega hike. One is that GDP growth is probably undercutting their 

forecast for 6% in Q2 and is more likely just above half that rate. Still, such growth is well above the economy’s noninflationary speed limit 

and is pushing the economy further into excess demand conditions best indicated by at least parts of the inflation picture. Second is the 

recent drop in jobs they might reference, but I don’t find that to be likely as argued here. Third is very nascent evidence that perhaps global 

supply chain pressures are beginning to ease as one of the drivers of inflation, versus the other which is a persistent move into excess 

demand. Fourth, interest sensitive sectors—namely housing—are rolling which should give them a perverse form of encouragement in that 

the transmission channels of tightened policy are working their way through.  

Some will say that the level of the C$ at just under 1.30 (USDCAD, 77 cents CADUSD) suggests it is an undervalued currency that leaves 

room for the BoC to hike more aggressively. Against this view is that the real effective exchange rate—which is trade weighted and adjusted 

for relative rates of inflation—has slightly appreciated since just before the pandemic (chart 5) in part because other currencies like the 

Mexican peso have depreciated against CAD over this time (chart 6). Canada has developed a serious competitiveness challenge partly 

because of this, partly because of tumbling labour productivity and partly because of relative expensive labour. Chart 7 shows that 

Canada’s unit labour costs—employment costs per unit of output which essentially combines productivity—have risen throughout the 

pandemic relative to Mexico’s. As a consequence, guess who is gaining market share in the US and who is not (chart 8). Canada’s high 

commodity prices may be all it has left going for it in terms of trade drivers of growth while interest-sensitive sectors retreat.

THE GLOBAL WEEK AHEAD 

Having said that, would the BoC return to cutting next year as markets have been flirting 

with of late? As chart 9 shows it isn’t impossible they do so given that the average distance 

between rate peaks and the first rate cut has been about a year since the GFC and less than 

that upon removing the one big outlier. The question is whether the experiences over the 

period between the GFC and now are instructive in terms of present challenges. I don’t think 

they are. For one thing, the long and variable lags between rate adjustments and the full 

effects on the economy are somewhere between 6–18 months amid debate over whether 

the rate responsiveness may be higher this time (given the interest sensitives that drove a 

lot of growth to date) or lower this time (given various arguments including a nascent 

services rebound). If so, then the BoC is unlikely to begin easing before the full effects have 

been felt. Secondly, after having botched inflation management to date, I think they’ll want 

to be darn sure that inflation has returned toward target and stayed there before easing.  

Also watch for important revisions to growth. Q2 GDP growth is coming in well shy of the 

BoC’s 6% April forecast but is likely still well above potential group such that the economy 

continues to push into excess demand while inflation is overshooting their forecasts as the 

more important point. The BoC will also ink their first attempt at forecasting Q3 GDP 

growth. 

US INFLATION—PERSISTENCE 

US CPI inflation for June lands on Wednesday (8:30amET). I’ve gone with 1.2% m/m for 

seasonally adjusted headline inflation and 8.9% y/y while expecting core inflation to hold 

steady at 6% y/y only because another large month-over-month gain of 0.8% should be 

enough to offset year-ago base effects that would otherwise put downward pressure on the 

year-over-year rate. 

If I’m right, then headline CPI will be running at a nearly 14% m/m rate in seasonally 

adjusted and annualized terms, with core CPI inflation running at 10% m/m at a seasonally 

adjusted and annualized rate. That would be the hottest core reading since June of last year 

while indicating continued upward pressure upon underlying inflation (chart 10). 

Here are the drivers: 

• 
Year-ago base effects on their own would drag the year-over-year rate of inflation 

down from 8.6% to 7.6%. I’ve said it over and over, but I’ll say it again: so what! If we 

judge inflationary pressures by looking at year-over-year rates instead of incremental 

evidence of inflationary pressures through a variety of month-over-month and breadth 

gauges then central banks and consensus will make the same mistakes they did 

throughout 2021.  

• 
The Cleveland Fed’s ‘nowcast’ of US inflation points toward a rise of about 8.7% y/y for 

headline CPI during June and is so far indicating sustained pressures into July despite 

year-ago base effects that should be lessening the pressures upon this reading (chart 

11). This measure has nevertheless been recently underestimating inflation and so there 

are the other following considerations. 

• 
Gasoline prices moved higher again. A 9% m/m rise at a 4½% weight in the basket 

should add about 0.4 percentage points to the m/m rate of CPI inflation. 

• 
Natural gas prices moved higher on a Henry Hub spot basis, but not enough to 

contribute to piped utility fuel prices in the basket given a 0.9% weight. 

• 
Used vehicle prices moved up by about 4 ½% m/m according to a proxy of the input 

source used by the BLS. At about a 4% basket weight this should add 0.2 ppts.

THE GLOBAL WEEK AHEAD 

• 
New vehicle prices were slightly higher but not 

enough to matter in weighted terms. 

• 
I’ve assumed another 1% rise in food prices 

split between groceries and at-home 

contributions. 

• 
And lastly I’ve assumed that reengagement 

effects particularly through high-contact 

service prices like airfare, lodging, car rentals, 

etc contribute to an extra three-tenths rise in 

inflationary pressures from a bottom-up 

standpoint. 

Amid all of the data noise are impetuous markets. 

The tone of much of the commentary around 

inflationary pressures is too skewed toward what 

might happen in the short-term versus addressing longer-run drivers of inflationary pressures, in 

addition to focusing too heavily upon year-over-year rates instead of higher frequency gauges.  

AND THE CENTRAL BANK OF THE YEAR AWARD GOES TO…. 

Three of the leading candidates for central bank of the year awards are poised to deliver fresh 

policy decisions this week. They are in this boat together for their relatively early tightening 

stances as global inflationary pressures began to escalate and with considerable distance from 

the initial emergency conditions of the pandemic. 

The Reserve Bank of New Zealand will be first out of the gates on Tuesday and it is expected to 

hike by another 50bps with consensus and Overnight Index Swap (OIS) market measures aligned. 

The RBNZ was among the early hikers as it raised its official cash rate by 25bps last August and 

would have raised it in July if not for the fact that a sudden burst of COVID cases prompted a 

shorter-lived government shutdown on the eve of that decision. Since then, the RBNZ has hiked 

by 175bps and a 2 ½% policy rate this week would make the RBNZ the first among the relatively 

mature market central banks to get its policy rate into restrictive territory. Its intent to overshoot 

the neutral rate was conveyed in the May statement that ended by noting “Once aggregate 

supply and demand are more in balance, the OCR can then return to a lower, more neutral, level.” Markets have generally come on side 

(chart 12). There may also be questioning or guidance around the start of the RBNZ’s legislated 5-year framework review that began on June 

1st with a public consultation period until July 15th on the path toward recommendations to the Finance Minister next year on issues like the 

2% inflation target. 

The Bank of Korea could give the RBNZ a run for its money as the poster child for prudent monetary policy. The BoK is also expected to hike 

by another 50bps on Thursday which would bring the 7-day repo rate up to 2 ¼%. The BoK first hiked last August and has raised its policy 

rate by 125bps to date (chart 13). At issue is how much further room for tightening there may be. The BoK has a 2% inflation target and 

estimates of its real neutral policy rate tend to be negative (here). If so, then market pricing for the nominal policy rate to roughly double 

within the next year imply a shift into significantly restrictive territory. Watch forward guidance on this matter. 

At Wednesday’s Banco Central de Chile (BCCh) meeting, we expect the committee to deliver a 50bps hike of the overnight rate to 9.50%, 

the highest rate since 1998. Like many of its LatAm peers, Chile is nearing the end of its tightening cycle, having hiked the policy rate a 

cumulative 850 bps since July 2021. However, with both headline and core inflation remaining stubbornly high, well in excess of the central 

bank’s 3 +/– 1% target (chart 14), most are calling for hikes into Q3-2022, where a likely pause followed by rate cuts should commence 

thereafter. Tighter financial conditions and removal of stimulus measures are weighing on Chile’s growth outlook, so future policy decisions 

will need to balance this with the hopes that price pressures will alleviate.

THE GLOBAL WEEK AHEAD 

THE Q2 US EARNINGS SEASON 

The Q2 US earnings season kicks off with the usual early focus upon key financials toward 

the end of the week. JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley release on Thursday followed 

by Citigroup, BlackRock, Wells Fargo and BoNYM on Friday. Other financials will be mixed 

into the fray along with Delta Air Lines that releases on Tuesday. Chart 15 shows the 

earnings expectations for the banks on the S&P500. 

OTHER GLOBAL MACRO REPORTS 

Major releases on the docket are due out from China, the US, Australia, South Korea and 

the UK. 

US retail sales will pale by comparison to CPI in terms of market significance but Friday’s 

estimates for June should offer up a healthy gain at least in nominal terms. Vehicle sales 

volumes were up by 2.5% m/m in June and prices also edged higher which should add to 

higher gasoline prices that were up by about 9% to drive the dollar value of total retail 

sales up by an estimated 1.3% m/m. Sales ex-autos and gas are expected to post a minor 

gain. After stripping out the effects of higher prices there may be little to no gain in sales 

volumes.  

Other US releases will include the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment survey for 

July (Friday). Watch the measures of inflation expectations after Fed Chair Powell cited 

the prior month’s run-up as a reason alongside the upside surprise in May CPI for shifting 

to a 75bps hike instead of 50bps (chart 16). Industrial output during June (Friday), the 

producer price index during June (Thursday), the Empire manufacturing gauge’s kick-off 

to another round of regional surveys (Friday) and the Fed’s Beige Book of regional 

conditions (Wednesday) will round out the calendar. 

China releases will also vie for attention. Chinese CPI inflation during June is expected to 

edge up again toward 2 ½% y/y when it gets released on Saturday, Beijing time. At some 

point during the week China will update aggregate financing figures for June that are 

expected to accelerate in the wake of prior easing. The People’s Bank of China is expected 

to leave its 1-year Medium-Term Lending Facility Rate unchanged at 2.85% one day this 

week. Chinese export and import growth during June will be updated by mid-week. Then 

the main release for Q2 GDP arrives on Thursday alongside June estimates for retail sales 

and industrial output that will help to inform hand-off effects for growth into Q3. China’s 

economy is expected to post a Q2 contraction in no small part due to Covid Zero 

restrictions, but also due to pressures upon its key export markets. 

Australia’s job market continues to push deeper into full employment, with another +60k 

jobs added in May alongside a participation rate that nudged up to a record 66.7% and an 

unemployment rate that sits at a historic low of 3.9%. Another modest gain is expected 

for June (consensus +30k), which would mark the eighth straight month of job gains and 

would put the total level of employment +508k above pre-pandemic levels (chart 17). 

Labour market strength has given the green light for the RBA to continue aggressively 

tightening, delivering a 50bps hike on July 5, with continuing hawkish guidance for further 

hikes.  

The South Korean labour market has been resilient in the face of the central bank’s 

tightening cycle which has been underway for the better part of the last 12 months. The 

slight uptick in unemployment rate in May, up a tenth of a percent to 2.8%, still sits in 

record low territory and was mainly driven by a healthy rise in the participation rate, up to

UK macro reports are likely to fly beneath the radar given the backdrop of political turmoil. 

Industrial output probably contracted in May and Wednesday will also reveal the same

a third consecutive retreat. 

Other Asian reports will include Indian CPI inflation for June (Tuesday) that is expected to hold

South African Reserve Bank – Repo Rate

July 21, 2022

5.00

Bank of Canada (BoC): A 75bps rate hike is expected with a modest risk of a bigger move that would go against 'gradual and measured' guidance. Forward 
guidance is likely to repeat a desire to quickly get up to the upper end of the neutral rate range or above within short order. Balance sheet plans are on auto-
pilot, but also watch for forecast revisions and guidance around when the BoC now expects to return inflation to the 2% target given further persistent 
upside surprises.

Banco Central de Chile (BCCh): We expect the Committee to raise the overnight rate by 50 bps to 9.50% at next week's meeting. We do not expect the rate 
to exceed 9.75% in this tightening cycle, which we expect to end in Q3-2022. From there on out, we expect rate cuts to commence with the overnight rate 
reaching 8.75% by year-end and 3.50% by end-2023.

Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ): RBNZ is expected to continue to raise its Official Cash Rate to 2.5% on July 12th. New Zealand’s domestic demand 
has remained resilient so far in 2022, despite the challenging global backdrop, and the tight labour market and rising inflation put the RBNZ on a continued 
tightening path. Bank of Korea (BoK): The Bank of Korea is expected to raise the Base Rate to 2.25% on July 14th, continuing to respond to strong 
inflationary pressures, with y/y CPI inflation climbing to 6.0% in June. People's Bank of China (PBoC): The PBoC is expected to hold it's one-year Medium-
Term Lending Facility at 2.85% next week. The Yuan has remained stable even as the Federal Reserve maintains its aggressive stance for further tightening. 
Q2 GDP, expected to land around the time of decision, is likely to be weak given Covid Zero policies but the PBoC has been taking steps such as draining 
short-term liquidity so as to signal unlikely nearer term policy easing.
