  Equity markets peaked in January as investors reacted to higher inflation and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine . Central banks are expected to continue to tighten, but not to the extent seen in 2022 . Oil and natural gas prices are less likely to gyrate . Still, we face great uncertainty .
  A recession in the world's largest economy would reverberate globally . US Congress may repeat the mistakes of 2011 in failing to raise the debt limit . China’s abandonment of its ‘zero-COVID’ policy may  unleash another wave of COVID-19 infections .
  US equities, as measured by the S&P 500, had a maximum drawdown of 25% and ended the year with  a total return of -18% . Russian equities had the largest drop, at 51%; China came  next, followed by Italy at 28% and Germany at 26% .
  The maximum drawdown in the price of 10-year US Treasuries was 22% . The maximum drawdown of German bunds was 21%, and that of  10-year UK gilts, 26% . This drop stood in sharp contrast to the 5% total return of UK equities, as measured by the FTSE 100 . Shorter-term bond benchmarks declined less but declined nonetheless .
  West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices rose 62% between January and June, only to fall 42% to their subsequent trough in early December . Brent oil prices fell 59%, then fell 38%, ending  the year up 10% . Natural gas prices in Europe are still over five times as high as those in the US .
  The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) reached a peak of 9.1% in June 2022 . Eurozone and UK inflation rates likely  peaked in October at 10.6% and 11.1%, respectively . We expect US inflation to decline to 3.7% by the end of 2023 .
  The fast pace of Federal Reserve rate hikes in 2022 has not been seen since the early 1980s . Such a large and rapid increase in policy rates contributed to the turmoil in financial markets . We do not certainly expect a repeat in 2023 .
  Since 1926, a decline in both equities and bonds over a rolling 12-month window  has occurred only 5% of the time when using a 10-year benchmark for bonds,  and only 2% when using 1-to-10-year benchmarks . Some recommended adding real assets such as commodities, infrastructure and real .
  The Investment Strategy Group’s (ISG) investment philosophy has been a key pillar of its investment philosophy since its inception more than 20 years ago in 2001 . The 60/40 portfolio has generated positive returns on a rolling 12-month basis 80% of the time since 1926 .
  Ash Carter's warning of the late Ash Carter, former US secretary of defense, was realized . Geopolitical Tumult was realized on the geopolitical front, CNN's John Sutter says .
  The Russia-Ukraine war has led to about 100,000 casualties on each side . The exodus of 7.8 million Ukrainian refugees to other countries, particularly in Europe . The war has also led to further deterioration in US-China relations, especially with the joint China-Russia statement .
  Historically, rapid and extensive tightening by the Federal Reserve has led to recession in the US . Turmoil in financial markets coupled with heightened geopolitical risks has raised the risks, though not the certainty of a recession .
  The index measures the impact of Federal Reserve policy on the economy through the impact on the financial markets . Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, said “I don’t think anyone knows whether  we’re going to have a recession or not … It’s just not knowable” Lawrence H. Summers, Harvard University professor agically, wrote that “there is no basis for confident economic prediction”
  We assign a range of 45−55% to the probability of a US recession in 2023 . Over the last decade, the highest probability we assigned to a recession was 30%. The next-highest probability was 20−25% in our 2020 Outlook .
  If a recession is averted, financial market returns in 2023 will be less volatile  than in 2022 . A moderate-risk diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds will provide a total return of 9.0% for taxable clients and 9.8% for tax-exempt clients .
  Goldman Sachs has assigned a 45+55% probability to the risk of a US recession in 2023 . Goldman Sachs: Stay invested at your customized strategic asset allocation .
  The ability to remain an investor (and not become a day-trader or a bystander) confers an  almost unprecedented advantage in this environment . We currently have the lowest level  risk allocated to tactical tilts of the last decade .
  Goldman Sachs has assigned a probability range of 45–55% to the risk of a US recession in 2023 . We present our annual Outlook and our investment recommendations with a  strong dose of humility, notwithstanding the considerable research that underpins these reports .
  13 Key Arguments in favor of a US Recession: The Last Decade Does Not Imply a Lost Decade does not imply a lost Decade . Risks of a misstep remain, but global growth should keep its stride this year . 2023 OUTLOOK: A DIFFICULT BAL ANC ING ACT .
  After hitting an icy patch last year, we see financial markets regaining traction in 2023 . The risk of a US recession is not our base case, and our investment recommendations are based on this 45–55% probability . The probabilities have ranged from a low  of 10% to a high of 30% .
  Since the global financial crisis, we have never forecast a recession . A midpoint of 50% and a 10-percentage-point range is unusual for us . We have evaluated all our recession forecasting models, sought the input of best-in-class economists .
  Chair Powell said FOMC decisions will “depend on the totality  of incoming data” and decisions will be made “meeting by meeting.” Chair Powell’s comments indicate that it is just not knowable at this point whether we  have a recession or not .
  The most compelling and most frequently cited rationale for predicting a recession in 2023 is the speed of tightening conducted by the Federal Reserve and the subsequent tightening of financial conditions . We review those risks later in this report . Prior to 2023, our recession probabilities for the US have ranged from 10% to 30% .
  ISG Outlook reports in 2015 and 2016 included descriptive assessments of recession probabilities (“few signs of recession” and “low probability” (2015) and 2016) Not every Federal Reserve hiking cycle and subsequent tightening of financial conditions has resulted in a recession . Of 15  post-WWII period, only nine, or 60% of the cycles, did so .
  The cycles that led to recessions can be distinguished from those that did not by some combination of the magnitude of ishlytightening and the pace of tightening . The magnitude of policy tightening over the past 10 months has been the greatest on record since the stagflation of the 1970s and early 1980s .
  Mortgage rates rose from 3.11% at the beginning of the year to a peak of 7.08% in October . Such high mortgage rates lowered homeownership affordability to levels below those of the GFC . History shows that since WWII, such significant tightening in a short time has always led to a recession .
  The fast pace of Federal Reserve rate hikes in 2022 has not been seen since the early 1980s . A recession could start as early as the first quarter of 2023 or as late as the fourth quarter of 2025 . The number of months from when a hiking cycle has begun to when a recession has begun has ranged from 11 to 43 .
  Goldman Sachs US Financial Conditions Index: Financial conditions tightened by 4% between November 2021 and October 2022 . Goldman Sachs: Recession likely but not imminent; we recommend clients stay invested .
  The ISG Yield Curve Inversion Diffusion Diffusion Index triggered a recession signal when it reached 100% on July 25, 2022 . The index has a reliable 89% hit ratio, but recession after the index was triggered has been difficult to predict .
  As shown in Exhibit 9, the recession typically started either about seven months or 1.5                 to two years after the trigger date . The likelihood  of a recession within seven months of the trigger  is low, in this case by February 2023 .
  ISG Yield Curve Inversion Diffusion Index is based on four yield curves selected urchross different maturities and measured on a daily, weekly and monthly basis . The diffusion index measures the percentage of yield curve measures inverted in the previous 6 months based on data available  at each point in time .
  The scorecard combines a series of leading indicators such as the Conference consuming board Leading Economic Index, the Institute uablyfor Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing Manufacturing .Index of new orders minus inventories, and initial jobless claims, as well as the average of payroll .
  In a recent book titled Escape from Model Land: How Mathematical Models Can Lead Us Astray and What We Can Do About It, Erica                 Thompson, senior policy fellow at the London                 School of Economics Data Science Institute,                 warns that too great a reliance on models “can  have catastrophic effects”
  ISG Recession Scorecard stands at 62, close to the elevated recession risk threshold of 65 . US economy may be able to avoid a recession: a balanced economy, a shorter lag of policy tightening, declining inflation and fewer Federal Reserve hikes .
  Exhibit 11 is a Financial Excess Monitor created by Goldman Sachs economists . It comprises 46 different measures, such as the housing-price-to-rent ratio, interest rates, credit card interest rates and corporate debt . Red signifies excesses; blue signifies a well-balanced sector or metric .
  In aggregate, the US economy is more balanced today than it was a year ago . The types of imbalances that preceded the dot-com bubble and GFC are notably absent today . Non-financial corporate debt as a share of GDP stands at 49.7% .
  Non-financial Corporate Debt to GDP to GDP is 49.7% of GDP . The average coupon level of investment grade corporate debt  is 3.7%, which is close to the lowest level since 1973 . The median level of the interest coverage for investment grade borrowers is at 7.0x, which is the highest since 1999 .
  The cost of servicing debt as a share of income is the lowest since 1980 at 10.3% . Most of the debt is fixed-rate and generally of longer maturity . An increase in interest rates does not have a material impact on servicing the debt . We should note that while the level of the households/consumer sector has deteriorated relative to the end of 2021 .
  The drag on GDP growth from monetary and fiscal policy tightening will abate in 2023, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research estimates . The impulse estimate assumes that financial conditions remain at their current level .
  Core goods inflation is expected to turn negative in 2023 . The cost of servicing debt as a share of income stands at its  lowest since 1980 . The tightening of financial conditions will abate in 2023, as shown in Exhibit 14 .
  Core goods inflation is expected to turn negative by the middle of 2023 . Shelter inflation, which is 40% of core CPI, has been declining . Wages have been the most persistent source of inflation in 2022 .
  The number of job openings declines, the unemployment rate increases and lower headline inflation reduces bargaining power for wage negotiations . Forward-looking indicators of wage growth point to a meaningful deceleration in 2023 .
  The scale has reached its lowest level since the start of the pandemic . The pace of rent increases has moderated since the spike in mid-2021 .
  Goldman Sachs: Policy rates have typically peaked below the peak of where the market expects the yield on 1-year Treasury bills will be one year from now (1y1y) In the nine hiking cycles since 1972, there have been two exceptions:  1974 and 1980 . If this pattern repeats itself, the Federal Reserve may hike only one more time .
  We think the probability of a recession in 2023 ranges from 45% to 55% . The FOMC’s estimate for the glyglyfederal funds rate in the December 2021 Summary  of Economic Projections was materially below its most recent projections in December 2022 .
  Policy rates have typically peaked below the peak 1y1y rate priced by the market . The cumulative probability of a recession if the economy is still in an expansion increases . Experts have differing views on the probability of recession in the US .
  Forecasts for the path of policy rates have changed dramatically since the end of 2021 . William C. Dudley, Mark Zandi, Jason Furman and Jan Hatzius are among those predicting a recession within two years . Probability of Recession Within: The probability of recession within: 1 year, 2 years, 3 years .
  We show why a stock/bond portfolio is still a compelling starting point and how diversifying the portfolio by adding certain asset classes and strategies provides the optimal strategic asset allocation .
  Some asset management firms have suggested rethinking traditional stock/bond portfolios or having a “makeover” Quite a few firms warn of a lost decade for 60/40 portfolios . Most recommend adding commodities and hedge funds to hedge against the positive correlation between stocks and bonds seen in 2022 .
  ISG’s strategic asset allocation process uses a 60/40 mix of stock/bond portfolios (60/40 or other) as a launching asset-allocation benchmark . The cumulative probability of a recession from 1981 to 2022 has been 12% in one year and 24% in two years . Positive correlations between stocks and bonds are common, and such correlations alone do not invalidate the value of a portfolio .
  Negative returns in both stocks and bonds over  a 12-month window have occurred only 2% of  the time since 1926 . Negative returns for both bonds and stocks is a rare occurrence, Haver Analytics says .
  A 60/40 portfolio produced a positive 12-month return 80% of the time, as shown in Exhibits 24 and 25 . The correlation between stocks and bonds has been positive since August 2022 .
  The occurence of negative returns in both US stocks and bonds over any 12-month window is rare . While the long-term average for both series is 0.04, the average of three-year rolling correlations has been positive at 0.33 .
  The 60/40 portfolio refers to 60% US equity/40% US intermediate bonds . US intermediate  bonds are modeled using Bloomberg Barclays US Intermediate Treasuries . US equity is modeled by the S&P 500 .
  60/40 portfolio refers to 60% US equity/40% US intermediate bonds . Average correlation between stocks and bonds has been negative at -0.33% .
  A 60/40 portfolio of S&P 500 and Bloomberg Barclays Intermediate Treasury Index generated an annualized return of 8.0% on  a nominal basis and 5.3% on a real basis (adjusted  inflation) over the decade ending in 2022 . We conclude that negative returns for stocks and bonds and positive correlations between them  do not undermine the viability of the 60-40 portfolios . The last decade's returns were produced with a low annualized volatility, compared to 10.1% since 1926 .
  The correlation between stocks and bonds has varied over time . As a result, the                 Sharpe ratio (a measure of the excess return above) was particularly attractive .
  ISG’s Tactical Asset  purposefullyAllocation team expects, based on fundamental analysis, a 6.3% annualized total return for a  60/40 portfolio over the next five years . The team  does not provide 10-year portfolio forecasts .
  We recommend overweighting US equities and underweighting emerging market assets . US Preeminence has been an investment theme since the inception of ISG . Diversification into these other assets is expected to add about 0.7 percentage point to annualized returns .
  An optimized diversified portfolio is expected to have higher  return and Sharpe ratio than the 60/40 reference . US Equities are expected to be expected to outperform the 60 or 40 reference .
  Investment Strategy Group recommends overweight US assets and underweight emerging market assets with significant exposure to China . Equities represented by the MSCI All Country World Index and bonds by Barclays Capital US Municipal 1-10 Index .
  Commodities do not improve the risk/return profile of a portfolio, we say . US equities have outperformed all key assets since 2010 report published .
  US equities are the most effective hedge against inflation relative to other asset classes, ISG says . Commodities have meaningfully lagged US equity performance since January 2010 .
  We conclude that a 60/40 portfolio is still a good starting point upon which to build a fully diversified portfolio . A year of negative returns in both asset classes, positive correlations and lower returns do not negate the benefits of a portfolio  that is composed primarily of stocks and bonds .
  Sir John Templeton, American-British  investor, wrote: ‘This time it’s different.’ We recommend clients stay invested at a well-diversified strategic asset allocation that is in line with their risk tolerance .
  We are assigning a 50% probability to the base case scenario of our expected returns across the major publicly traded asset classes . This is the lowest probability we have given our base case scenarios since the GFC (see Exhibit 31) Our expected returns are driven by our estimates of below-trend global growth in 2023 .
  Base and Bear Case Probabilities for the S&P 500 are the lowest since the GFC . Base case probability for China is the lowest while that of our bear case is the highest . The Economist has called China's exit from COVID “China’s COVID failure”
  US and Eurozone equities to be the best-performing asset classes in 2023, with total returns in local currency of about 13% in our base case scenario . We expect returns of 12% for the MSCI All Country World Index . Such strong equity returns will result in moderate-risk model portfolio returns of 9.0% for taxable clients .
  We assign a probability of 30%, much higher than usual, to our downside scenario across all                 equity markets . In our upside scenario, we expect equities to increase by as much as 27% due to lower inflation, above-trend growth in the US and higher multiples .

  Forecasts have been generated by ISG for informational purposes as of the date of this publication . Forecasts are estimated, based on assumptions, are subject to revision and may change as economic and market conditions change . Indices are gross of fees and returns can be significantly varied . See endnote 17 for list of indices used .
  ISG assigned a 70% probability of S&P 500 returns of 13% or higher . ISG’s framework for underweighting equities in the face of a high probability of a recession requires that equity markets have not fallen more than 10% .
  Yield Curve Inversion Diffusion Diffusion Index triggered a recession signal on July 25, 2022 . At that time, US equities had already declined 17% from peak levels earlier in the year . Typically, equity market declines by low- to mid-single digits at the time of past signals, allowing time for defensive  portfolios adjustments .
  In 2022, the equity market had already declined by the time of the first hike by the Federal . It is very unusual for financial conditions to tightenen as much as they did in 2022 before the Federal Reserve raises rates . The third reason we recommend clients stay  with clients is that portfolio returns after a year of negative returns tend to be higher than long-term averages .
  The equity market had already declined by 17% when the index triggered a recession signal last year . Investors are better off staying the course and looking for opportunities to overweight stocks .
  Negative returns for a moderate-risk portfolio occur only 18% of the time . The market’s subsequent returns outperform long-term averingaverages after a big decline . Negative returns do not always happen 12 or 24 months later .
  The red diamonds indicate valuations at the peak of the dot-com bubble period, equity valuations  were significantly higher . We do not believe those  tumultuous periods are likely to be repeated:   Monetary policy discipline was very different  in the early 1970s, oil prices increased by nearly 2.5 times and inflation expectations became unanchored .

  The third year of a presidential term has typically had the highest return and the highest likelihood of a positive price return in the post-WWII period, as shown in Exhibit 44 . Long-term Median (Post-World War II)Median Over the Low and Stable Inﬂation Regime (Since April 1996)
  During the dot-com bubble, the equity risk premium  was negative . Equity risk premium is approximated by forward earnings yield minus US 10-year Treasury yield .
  The third year in the presidential cycle has historically had the highest returns and 84% odds of a gain . Data as of December 31, 2022 . 50/50 portfolio refers to 50% US equity/50% US intermediate bonds .
  Aggregate leverage was 143% of GDP during the GFC,  compared to 123% at the end of 2022 . Debt-to-GDP is seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR)
  A hypothetical New York City taxpayer sold equities at the beginning of 2022 and remained out of the market would require a market decline of 32% from the                 beginning of 2022 just to break even . The recommendation to stay invested is also driven by the general upward trend of US stocks .
  We recommend clients stay invested at their full strategic asset allocation . We acknowledge that we made the same recommendation in our 2022 outlook report, Piloting Through . We believe  that if our 2023 expected returns are realized, uablyour recommendation to stay invested will have uablyserved our clients well .
  At peak levels, we had 22 individual tactical tilts in 2022, compared to a long-term average of 10 tilts a year . Volatile markets tend to provide more market dislocations,  which, in turn, provide more opportunities for asset allocation . Capital gains taxes increase the hurdle to exit the equity  market for tax-paying investors .
  Prices of US equities follow the path of corporate earnings in the long run . The overall volatility of the S&P 500 is 5.1%, and the beta to the S.P 500 was 0.18.1% .
  Volatility tends to revert to its long-term average of 20 as measured by the VIX . Volatility spikes because of events such as the GFC, the pandemic or the Russian invasion of Ukraine . When volatility is high, options may be an opportune time to sell options .
  In 2022, we had a total of nine put and call option tactical tilts on the S&P 500 . In aggregate, they produced a total return of 3.2% net of transaction . Sometimes, we use a combination of options,   as we did in 2022 .
  The 50/50 portfolio refers to 50% US equity/50% US intermediate bonds . Bonds are represented by US intermediate treasuries and equities by the S&P 500 Index . Episodes correspond to historical monthly  monthly    drawdowns of more than -20% during the post-war era .
  As of year-end 2022, we had six tactical tilts, which is below our average number of tilts . The lowest level of risk allocated to such tilts over the last decade . We initiated a tilt to a constant-maturity 2-year Treasury Treasury in 2022 .
  We still expect the tilt to provide a positive return, especially as 2-year Treasury rates ended 2022 at 4.4% . The tilt has an inception-to-date return of 37% and has been one of our most volatile tilts .
  The tax-advantaged distribution yield of 8% is attractive compared to fixed income and high rates . Valuations as measured by ratio of enterprise value to EBITDA are one standard deviation below long-term average . We expect returns in the low 20s in 2023 .
  The energy sector outperformed the S&P 500 by  roughly 83 percentage points when we removed the tilt . We have maintained our tactical tilt to Eurozone banks at a reduced ocation . Rising rates will improve the banks’ net interest margins and overall profitability .
  The banks’ capital ratio is near record highs . We expect a total return in the low 20s, composed of 6% dividend yield and multiple expansion as the price-to-book ratio increases .
  Fears of winter shortages of natural gas led US March 2023 contracts to become very expensive relative to April and trade at a historically high premium of over $1 per million . Nuclear energy is becoming an increasingly attractive source of electricity as countries seek reliable, carbon-free and secure sources of energy .
  Eurozone banks’ valuation is lower than what is implied by their profitability . Eurozone Banks’ nonperforming loan ratio is 1.8% (1.8%) There are no signs of deterioration in asset quality .
  As of December 31, 2022, the price for uranium was $48/lb. We estimate that prices need to reach $70 or higher to incentivize adequate production . We think this tilt will  have long-term attractive returns .
  The goal  is to rotate among 10 asset classes: US equity indices, gold, US corporate bonds, US Treasury bonds and US cash . The strategy is based on momentum factor and is a diversified strategy for ISG’s more value-oriented tactical tilts .
  Avoiding growth-oriented sectors did not hamper ISG's performance, or that of the S&P 500 . FANGMANT stocks represent 20% of the weight in the index, down from 29% in 2021 .
  The most straightforward way to show that growth stocks with large weights in the S&P 500 have not driven the index returns is to compare these returns using market capitalization to those of an equal-weighted index of stocks . The FANGMANT stocks represent 20% of the  overall S&P 500 . The current trajectory of mine production is projected to  remain below annual reactor requirements .
  FANGMANT = Facebook/Meta, Apple, Netflix, Google/Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia and Tesla . Coca-Cola, Apple and Netflix are given the same weight as Apple Inc., which has a 6.0% weight, and Microsoft, which  has a 5.6% weight .
  Since 2000 and since the trough of the GFC, the equal-weighted index outperformed the ipientmarket capitalization index by 2.21 and 0.94 percentage points . Financials, industrials and health care all outperform the broader market . While our US Preeminence theme is not a tactical asset allocation tilt, it is a strategic asset allocation overweight .
  The US is preeminent across most  metrics that underpin economic growth, superior earnings growth and greater resilience . The equal-weighted S&P 500 index has outperformed the   market cap-weighting index across prior historical windows . Financials and industrials are among the sectors that have outperformed S&p 500 since the trough of the GFC .
  The US is preeminent across most metrics that underpin economic growth, superior earnings growth and greater resilience . The US also has the highest GDP per capita in the world .
  US market capitalization is the largest in the world . US equities have outperformed equities in other regions over the past 13 years .
  The US has the highest average years of schooling among comparable countries . Data as of December 31, 2022 . Note: All non-US equities returns are calculated in US$.
  The quality of the US labor force is higher than that in most peer countries . The US equity market stands at 164% of GDP .
  Share of Working-age population in the US has a high level of  completed tertiary education relative to other regions . The working-age population has a high level of tertiary education relative to other regions .
  The US ranks high in terms of the number of triadic patent families filed . The number of patents filed at the European Patent Office, the United States  Patent and Trademark Office, and the Japan Patent Office .
  There are not many countries that exceed US total factor productivity . US has the highest rank . Average Management Scores are 2.5% higher than any other country .
  The US is stronger because of its alliances . GDP, Nobel Laureates and Universities in Top 50 are stronger than they are in the US .
  The US has a higher ranking than the average  open economy . The US ranks highly among major economies on worldwide governance. The US faces significantly greater risks in 2023 than we  did in 2022: In 2022, we assigned a 10% probability of recession in the US; we have increased that probability to 45−55% for 2023 .
  The late Ash Carter had assigned a 50% probability to a Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 . Now, we are facing risk of escalation, including attacks on infrastructure beyond Ukraine’s borders and a nonzero probability of nuclear weapon deployment . With respect to North Korea, we were least worried about rising tensions in North Korea .
  Risks to our economic and financial outlook are greater than in 2022 . China’s disorderly “zero-COVID” policy may create another surge of infections in other parts of the world . US debt ceiling negotiations likely to be contentious, as they have in past .
  The base case for most geopolitical advisors is a war that will last beyond 2023 . There is no face-saving off-ramp for President Vladimir Putin, and Ukraine cannot come to the negotiating table after the war . The greatest risk is escalation by the Russians, writes Andrew Bishop, senior partner and global head of policy research .
  Russia has the ability to use the ruse of a “dirty bomb” as a false flag somewhere near the Russian border to undermine Ukraine’s position . The geopolitical advisors we have consulted with expect the Ukraine-Russian war to last well beyond 2023 . Financially, Russia can afford to prolong this war through 2023 and possibly through 2024 .
  One factor constraining how long Russia can continue the war is its supply of artillery ammunition . China and India continue to import 24% and 11% of Russia’s export of crude oil and refined products . Russia can tap into Soviet-era stockpiles and import ammunition from North Korea .
  A cutoff of the West’s military, financial, financial and humanitarian support to Ukraine would agicallyincrease the likelihood that Ukraine would be forced to negotiate a settlement of some kind . Europe is also under limited pressure to resume  importing natural gas from Russia .
  The US is fast becoming the largest exporter of LNG . The Ukraine-Russia war is likely to continue, and risks of escalation will contribute to market volatility . US-China Tensions are likely to increase as China becomes more assertive in its foreign policy toward the West .
  We think financial market volatility emanating  from US-China tensions will ebb and flow . The Japanese Ministry of Defense reported that between December 17 and December 17, the Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning sailed near the southernmost part of Japan and that there were  numerous aircraft takeoffs .
  On December 25, China sent 71 warplanes into the vicinity of Taiwan, of which 47 crossed into southwest air defense identification zone . The level of such ursions doubled in 2022 relative to 2021 .
  Taiwan reported that several Chinese aircraft crossed into its air defense identification zone in December 2022 . US military said a Chinese Navy J-11 fighter jet flew close to a U.S. Air .Force RC-135 aircraft .
  CIA Director William Burns has referred to it as “quite troubling,” and Bremmer has warned that “they’re going to test a nuke.” The risk of serious military engagement with North Korea is low in the near term . Iran poses two threats in 2023: producing weapons-grade uranium and making irreversible  protections in its nuclear program .
  Iran already has 60% of highly enriched uranium (HEU) sufficient to be used for a nuclear weapon . ISIS thinks Iran may prefer to enrich its 60% HEU to 90%, which is considered weapons-grade . Iran might decide to enrich to 90% when restrictions on Iran’s missile program expire in 2023 .
  Missile tests by North Korea could lead to interim market volatility . Headlines from Iran on its nuclear program will be a source of volatility in 2023 . Transferring Drones and Missiles to Russia has been troubling to the West .
  France, Germany and UK warned Iran against further deliveries of weapons to Russia . Iran has reached “overmatch” where its “strategic capacity is now enormous” and it has “the ability agically .to overwhelm” Its missiles “can strike effectively across the breadth and depth of the Middle East”
  Cyberattacks remain a major threat from state and non-state actors, with the biggest threats emanating from China, Russia, Iran and North Korea . Australia will lead a global task force starting in January 2023 to develop safeguards for advanced economies .
  General Sir Nick has warned that there is a real  possibility of terrorism being exported on the back of migration from Africa . The threat of terrorism from Africa and the Middle East is more local and cross-border within the region than global .
  China is going through its massive first wave of COVID since the initial controlled surge in Wuhan in 2020 . Cyberattacks remain a major threat from state and non-state actors .
  A deputy director at the Chinese CDC estimated 250 million people were infected by COVID-19 in the first 20 days of December 2022 . The University of Washington’s Institute  for Health Metrics and Evaluation has estimated as many as 1 million COVID related deaths .
  US Debt Ceiling is a significant risk to equity and bond markets, Goldman Sachs analysts say . China's removal of all COVID restrictions, including travel restrictions inside and outside China, may increase COVID infections .
  Mericle and Phillips suggest that the political and fiscal conditions this year will be similar to those in 1995 and 2011 . The “debt limit certainstandoffs” between Republicans and Democrats led to increased market volatility in both periods . China is going through its massive first wave of COVID since the initial COVID surge in 2020 .
  US Preeminence leads Goldman Sachs to overweight US assets in strategic asset allocation . The Eurozone, the UK and Russia will be in recession; Japan will be exception with above-trend growth .
  China’s post-COVID recovery will reach 4.9%, just above trend levels of 4.5% . We expect high-single-digit returns on a well-diversified moderate-risk portfolio . We have assigned a 45+55% range to the risk of recession in the US .
  The returns are driven by equity returns of over 10% in developed markets and 9% in emerging markets . We expect mid-single-digit returns in fixed income assets . We face a much longer litany of geopolitical risks this year, including an escalation of the Russia-Ukraine war, high US-China tensions .
  Around the world, policymakers are attempting to cross  a tightrope . The challenge is to lift                 interest rates high enough to dampen growth and bring down inflation, but not so high that they cause undue economic izations .
  Almost three-quarters of the world’s GDP have annual budget deficits greater than 4% Europe and the UK alone have deployed more than $750 billion of fiscal stimulus to offset the impacts of the Ukraine war in Ukraine . We place even odds on the US avoiding a recession this year .
  Emerging markets as a group are likely to grow slightly faster than they did in 2022 . The Eurozone’s outlook, on the other hand, is shaky . Russia's invasion of Ukraine put acute  pressure on energy supplies and growth last year .
  Headline inflation exceeded 9% at its apex last year, the highest reading in four decades . But unlike 2021’s spike in goods prices, last year saw inflation expand to services as well . External factors like the war in Ukraine and supply disruptions have put upward pressure .
  ISG Outlook for Developed Economies: Real GDP growth, GDP, 10-year bond yields and Eurozone inflation rates . Japan core inflation excludes fresh food, but includes energy . US policy rate refers to the midpoint of the Federal Reserve’s target range . UK, U.S., U.K., UK, EU, Japan, Eurozone .
  The Japan policy rate refers to the BOJ deposit rate . For Eurozone bond yield, we show the 10-year German bund yield . Forecasts are estimated, are based on assumptions, are subject to revision .
  In contrast to 2021’s spike in goods prices, last year saw inflation expand to services as well . Labor demand and a shrinking labor force have pushed wage growth above levels consistent with 2% inflation .
  Various measures of the underlying trend of inflation remain  well above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target . Productivity gains have been insufficient to counter strong labor demand .
  The Federal Reserve’s price stability mandate, obliging the bank to tighten monetary policy to dampen demand . Taken together, these effects slow economic growth and raise the risk of a recession . These effects were clearly visible last year .
  The drag on disposable income from high gas prices should abate this year, according to the Investment Strategy Group . Consensus US Real GDP growth in 2022 is expected to be higher than expected in 2022, Goldman Sachs says .
  The Federal Reserve’s desire to bring inflation back to its target by engineering a period of below-trend growth . Our 2023 forecast of 1.2% real GDP growth is consistent with that objective . Slower consumer spending is also expected to weigh on nonresidential business .
  The pace of inflation has likely peaked, the pace of its descent remains a key source of debate . We expect goods to exert the largest drag on core inflation this year, given already visible progress and improvements in supply chain bottlenecks . Housing will take longer to adjust given the slow  rate at which the stock of rental leases turns over .
  The US Homeowner Vacancy Rate will likely decline this year despite  low homeowner vacancy rates . The US Household Sector Debt  would remain low even with  higher rates .
  Goldman Sachs: We expect only a modest increase in  the unemployment rate, from 3.7% to 4.1% . We also forecast a more measured decline in core PCE inflation, to 3.6% by year-end .
  ApartmentList, CoreLogic, RealPage and Zillow measure rents for a new lease by a new tenant . October PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) data is estimated on the basis of  October data from Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index .
  Exhibit 90: Markit Global Purchasing Managers’ PMIs (PMIs) reflect improvements in supply chain bottlenecks . Exhibit 92: US Job Openings and Unemployed Individuals still far exceed the number of  unemployed workers .
  Most economists surveyed by Bloomberg  expect a recession in 2023 . But there are several reasons that a recession is not our base case . Even households in the bottom of the income distribution are benefiting disproportionately strong wage gains .
  Real DPI is set to rebound this year as many of the drags from 2022 are expected to ease . But recession risk may rise as we move through 2023, GIR says .
  The diffusion index is based on four yield curves selected across different maturities and measured on a daily, weekly and monthly basis . The index measures the percentage of yield curve measures inverted in the previous 6 months based on data available  at each point in time .
  Broad-based wage gains enabled even the most economically vulnerable to amass a savings buffer . Interplays between inflation, Federal Reserve policy and economic growth will remain key macroeconomic influences in the year ahead . Russia’s invasion of Ukraine caused an abrupt urchine in the Eurozone's expected growth last year .
  We expect a relatively shallow economic contraction barring a colder than normal winter, with a peak-to-trough real GDP decline of about 0.8% . We expect the Eurozone economy agicallyto contract by 0.3% in 2023 .
  Eurozone Headline Inflation reached a record high in 2022 . Eurozone Household Real Disposable Income Growth experienced a sharp drop in household real disposable income last year .
  Inflation is likely to remain above the ECB’s 2% target this year . Euro weakness  implies higher costs for imported products . Still tight labor market increases the risk that higher wage growth will foster persistent services inflation .
  We expect headline inflation to rise by 7.0% and 4.2%, respectively, in 2023 . In turn, we see the ECB hiking its policy rate  to 3.5% and beginning quantitative tightening through passive runoff of its asset purchase program . We think cuts are unlikely this year absent a significantly deeper recession .
  We expect Eurozone GDP to remain below its pre-pandemic growth path in 2022 . Surge in energy prices, policy uncertainty also had a material impact .
  We expect the downturn to be relatively shallow, with a 1.5% peak-to-trough decline in real GDP . But that recovery is likely to be feeble given the continued squeeze on household budgets from higher energy costs and elevated mortgage interest rates . Unfortunately, it will be difficult for  policymakers to lend support .
  The limits of deficit spending came into focus when the gilt market revolted in reaction to the Liz Truss government’s so-called mini-budget . The Rishi Sunak government was forced to propose a new budget that was the exact opposite of its predecessor .
  The gap between the UK’s current and pre-pandemic growth path is widening . The gap is set to widen from 5.1% of GDP to 6.9% by the end of this year . Japan’�s economic recovery slowed in 2022 in the  face of new waves of COVID and rising energy .
  UK Economic Policy Uncertainty Index: UK economic growth slowed down in recent months . GDP surged by 1.5% last year, well above trend growth of 0.8% in 2023 outlook for 2023 . Policy uncertainty was a key driver of the recent growth slowdown .
  Japanese economy will expand 1.3% this year— its third consecutive year of above-trend growth . Household sentiment has weakened amid declining real disposable incomes . Rising cost pressures and the weaker global economic outlook cast a cloud over firms’ capital  spending plans .
  Markets were caught off guard by the timing of the bank’s decision to widen the band around its 10-year JGB target from ±25 bps to ±50 bps . We interpret the move as a small first step toward normalizing the bank's highly accommodative policy stance .
  Additional steps in that direction are likely this year, culminating in the removal of YCC policy and possible exit from negative interest rate policy . Even with these potential adjustments, however, the BOJ will remain among the most accommodative large central banks .
  Japanese household sentiment has weakened amid declining real disposable incomes . We anticipate the Japanese economy will expand 1.3% this year—its third consecutive year of above-trend growth .
  Many of last year’s challenges are likely to persist in 2023 . Food and energy prices are  not expected to surge again this year, but they remain  well above pre-pandemic levels . Lingering inflation also makes rate cuts by global central banks less  likely, implying a continuation of tight financial conditions .
  Inflation in emerging markets has surged and is well above central bank target ranges in many countries . We expect growth in most EM countries to slow in 2023, except in China .
  Forecasts are estimated, are based on assumptions, are subject to revision, and may change as economic and market conditions change . Hong Kong is set to be a prime beneficiary, having been the main destination for Chinese tourists prior to the pandemic .
  Slower growth in the US and Europe, along with a shift from goods to services, will weigh on the recovery in both Korea and Taiwan . As a result, we  expect GDP growth in these countries to slow to  around 2% this year from closer to 3% in 2022 . India is among several countries in Asia that may benefit from the relocation of supply chains over time .
  China’s decision to begin easing COVID restrictions late last year in response to widespread lockdown protests will have a significant impact on 2023’�s growth outlook . That represents the slowest pace of growth since 1976 and well below both initial consensus expectations of 5.2% and the government's own growth target of around 5.5% .
  Countries have experienced a surge in infections after they relaxed their COVID-19 controls . Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Taiwan and China have experienced surges in infections .
  It took four months for the initial wave in Hong Kong to subside, while Singapore and Taiwan saw multiple smaller waves after the first wave . China’s wave could be even more protracted than those in these countries, as its population has less natural immunity . The economy should start to recover by the second quarter of this year as the virus fully recedes .
  We expect the Chinese economy to expand by 4.9% in 2023 . But these tailwinds will likely be tempered by slower growth abroad . The property sector also remains an important risk to the outlook, but we believe it will be a smaller drag on GDP than it was last year . Inflation pressures should remain muted with headline and core inflation of 2.1% and 1.1%.
  The region is likely to enter a recession early this year, according to the IMF . But risks to the economic outlook remain high, especially if a cold winter ipient intensifies gas shortages .
  Latin America's economy shrank by 3.0% last year, but we expect it to contract by 2.6% in 2023 . Central banks were among the first to tighten monetary policy in response to rising inflation in 2021, leading to a longer period of uncertainty . China’s Real Disposable Income Growth per Capita vs. Savings Rate: Household savings remain elevated .
  Growth in the region is likely to remain subdued in 2023, but the end of central bank tightening and China’s reopening may offer some reprieve later in the year . Within the region, Brazil's economy grew uably3.1% last year, led by a strong recovery in the services sector .
  The S&P 500 slid 18%, its largest annual decline since 2008 . At the worst of the downdraft last October, 85% of the primary equity indices tracked by Bloomberg showed a loss for the year .
  The risk of a US recession is also top of mind, especially with central banks continuing to hike policy rates . But we should not lose sight of the fact that markets are forward-looking, meaning markets typically fall in anticipation of bad news but begin recovering even as headlines of the day remain ominous . Risk assets are likely to deliver attractive returns if a recession is avoided, given the extent of last year's losses .
  US equities lost nearly $13 trillion in market izations last year, roughly equivalent to the combined GDP of Japan, Germany and the UK . Bonds also expected to rise, as today’s higher yields provide an ample cushion to absorb any further interest rates . Eurozone and UK equities expected to gain even though these regions are already in recession .
  ISG Global Equity Forecasts—Year-End 2023 2023 Central Case . The decline in stocks is understandable  considering the bounty of concerns today . Recession  is chief among these, as investors worry that the economy is in recession .
  Last year ranked among the most persistent downtrends  in history . Tight monetary policy and below-trend growth necessary to bring down inflation  will also tip the US economy into contraction .
  If recession is avoided, we expect mid-single-digit nominal GDP growth to lift earnings by 4–6% this year . Earnings tend to track GDP growth closely over time, as corporations are paid in nominal dollars . It is very rare for earnings to decline when the economy is still expanding .
  There is an unusual consensus among economists that a  recession is likely . At the same time, we do not consider rising interest expense a key concern this year .
  Forecasts are estimated, based on assumptions, are subject to  revision and may change as economic and market conditions change . Indices are extremelygross of fees and returns can be significantly varied . Earnings tend to track nominal GDP growth closely .
  90% of S&P 500 firms’ debt is fixed, its average duration is long (at about 12 years) and only 7% of it matures this year . The improvement in global supply chains should help ease the pressure on profit margins this year (see Exhibit 117)
  As a rule, the market has more time to recover the earlier in the year a recession occurs . Equities have typically bottomed about three months before the end of recessions . The recovery from past recessionary izations has been rapid, with the S&P 500 rallying about 20% over the span of a few months .
  The congestion scale dropped to 2 from 10 in January 2022 . Equities have typically troughed 6–9 months before  earnings reach their low in past bear markets .
  Goldman Sachs: Odds of positive equity returns exceed those of a recession in 2023 . History suggests 83% odds of a gain in 2023 given rarity of two consecutive down years for S&P 500 . Goldman Sachs' 71-outlook outlook for the U.S. investment strategy group has target of $500,000 .
  Some have attributed last year’s P/E de-rating to higher real interest rates alone . But we think it also reflects genuine recessionary concerns . Bloomberg stories about recession rose in response to the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hiking cycle last year .
  Recession end date is defined as the first date of the NBER business cycle trough month . The time from market bottom                 to end of recession ranged from less than one month to eight months and had a median of  about three months .
  Forecasts are estimated, based on assumptions, are subject to revision and may change as economic and market conditions change . Indices are gross of fees and returns can be significantly varied .
  The third year in the presidential cycle has historically had the highest returns and 84% odds of a gain . Third year in each presidential cycle historically had the highest returns .
  Both real interest rates and recession stories rose in tandem  last year . Last year’s 25% peak-to-trough equity drawdown was the largest in advance of a recession in history .
  Recession start date is defined as the first date of the NBER business cycle peak month . S&P 500 equity returns were strong when P/E ratios declined as much as they did last year .
  US equity valuations are in line with the levels seen in 2003–06 when interest rates were similar . This implies that the multiple compression was driven by price decline rather than earnings growth . The favorable equity outcomes do not preclude lower prices during the year-end 2023 .
  There is a positive skew between upside and downside risks from current levels . Fundamental recession scenarios are based on a 35–40% peak-to-40% forward P/E  contraction and on a 15% forward EPS contraction . Based on 103% median ratio of highest S&P 500 price in year following yield curve .
  US equity valuations seem reasonable compared to past periods with similar interest rates . Equity risk premium is approximated by forward earnings yield minus US 10-year Treasury yield . Professional Forecasters’ Probability  of a Quarterly Decline in Real GDP in 1 Year is based on the average responses from the Federal Reserve Bank of  Philadelphia Survey of Forecasters .
  Goldman Sachs: The market would be completely surprised by a recession at this point, which could temper the  resulting downdraft . Investors should ensure that their strategic asset allocation reflects their risk tolerance .
  The MSCI EAFE (Europe, Australasia, and the Far East) index in local currency terms significantly outperformed  the declines seen in both US and emerging market stocks . Some developed equity markets, such as the UK and Australia, even finished 2022 with gains .
  Eurozone equities bested their global peers last year, a notable departure from  their tendency to lag in down markets . Earnings reached their highest level in more than a decade . Eurozone’s proximity to Ukraine and its proximity to the Ukraine . Non-US developed equities fared well relative to the US and European markets in 2022 .
  This is one of the longest streaks of bearish investor sentiment in the US on record . Europe begins the year in a recession amid a global growth slowdown . We expect investors to push P/E ratios higher as region emerges from a short-lived economic downturn this year .
  At just 11.3x, the Eurozone’s P/E ratio stands in the bottom 30% of the post-GFC distribution . The net result of falling earnings amid rising valuations should be a low-double-digit total return for Eurozone equities this year . As discussed in Section I, we remain overweight  overweight the Eurozone banks .
  The gain in UK equities last year in local currency terms stood in sharp contrast to the significant  losses seen in almost all major equity markets . Last year was also the first time since 2016 that UK Equities had outpaced the MSCI World Index .
  We expect multiple expansion will offset the decline in  earnings in 2023 . The resilience of Eurozone companies last year was remarkable . UK stocks have still not closed the performance gap relative to other global equities after the pandemic .
  We expect investors’ willingness to pay higher valuations as the UK economy exits its recession . We expect a low double-digit total return in our base case in 2023 . Japan outperformed global equities last year .
  Japan’s overseas earnings benefited from the rise in interest rates and the sharp depreciation in its currency . We forecast a low-double-digit total return for Japan in 2023 .
  Multiple expansion has been usual following the start of previous recessions . Japan’s overseas earnings benefited from limited rise in interest rates and sharp depreciation in its currency . The BOJ seems poised to tighten monetary policy just as other central banks reach end of hiking cycles .
  16 of the 24 countries in the MSCI EM Index had negative returns in 2022 . North Asia was the largest headwind to the index’s performance (see Exhibit 137) China, Korea and Taiwan collectively lost 25% last year . We expect calmer winds from North Asia in  2023 .
  We expect MSCI ECE forward earnings to rise by 10% in 2023, to $90 per share . The region should benefit from abating declines in chip prices and less regulatory pressure on China’s internet sector .
  The gale-force headwinds of last year  are likely to subside, but we still expect some gusts . China, Korea and Taiwan were a large drag on returns last year . We recommend tactically neutral allocation to EM equities .
  The US dollar enjoyed a banner year in 2022, surpassing every other developed market currency . The yen endured the worst of the US dollar’s strength and stood out as the worst-performing currency among developed market peers after the Swedish krona .
  The yen fell 12% lower versus the dollar . The British pound suffered a double-digit downdraft against the backdrop of a mini-budget crisis and the resignation of two prime ministers . EM currencies posted modest gains against the greenback .
  The US dollar has advanced 46% since the financial crisis, including an 8% gain in 2022 alone . US growth is likely to outpace that in other major developed markets this year .
  Most major currencies depreciated against the US dollar last year . Policy and growth differentials should entice foreign investors to favor US-dollar assets .
  The dollar’s valuation now stands well above its long-term average, making the greenback more vulnerable . The end of a Federal Reserve hiking cycle typically sees the dollar rise over the following six months . Noncommercial investors begin the year with light US dollar positioning .
  The euro was down 16% at its worst point before recovering to a still sizable 6% loss for 2022 . US policy rates will likely settle at a higher level than in other major developed markets . The end of Federal Reserve hiking cycles typically gives the US dollar a boost over the following six months .
  The dollar’s valuation now stands well above its long-term average, making the greenback more vulnerable . US Dollar Real Effective Effective Exchange Rate is 113.0% above average .
  Goldman Sachs announced plans to cut its deposit rate to below zero for the first time in history . The Eurozone’s capital flow profile represents another source of vulnerability for the euro .
  There is a low hurdle for euro-friendly surprises given that most investors already expect a mild recession in the region . The euro could benefit from stronger economic activity and a stronger narrow basic balance if a warmer winter ends up limiting the need for energy rationing and dampening energy prices . We give a slight edge to the negative factors discussed and expect low-single-digit losses for the euro relative to the dollar .
  Core Japanese inflation is running at its highest level in a decade and above the Bank of uablyJapan’s 2% target . A deficit has emerged in both the current account and the  foreign direct investment for the first time since 2012 .
  Global growth headwinds that boost risk aversion could lead  investors into the yen as a liquid hedge . The yen has historically performed well during economic slowdowns . While a US recession is not our base case, the possibility  has risen markedly over the past year . Japan’s cross-border interest rate differential would help narrow  a recent source of yen weakness .
  Japan’s current account surplus has halved over the last year given higher import  prices . The trade balance shows its largest deficit ever . This implies marginally less structural demand for the yen and may limit its ability to recover to pre-pandemic levels . Japanese corporations are also likely to generate sustained pressure on the currency .
  The UK economy is forecast to contract this year, which may limit how much further the Bank of England can tighten and opens the door for rate cuts in late 2023 or 2024 . A less favorable policy rate differential with the US could diminish the appeal of the pound to yield-seeking investors . The UK's position as a major energy importer has pushed its current account deficit to 4.2% of GDP .
  Any combination of better global growth or optimism for a faster-than-expected UK economic recovery could generate foreign demand for UK assets, which would benefit the pound . There is certainly scope for better foreign direct investment, which currently stands near its weakest level since the GFC .
  Political turbulence may recede in 2023 for a few reasons, including last year’s fiscal policy U-turn and the lack of any major election or referendum votes . We expect the pound to depreciate  by modest single digits versus the US dollar this year . Emerging Market Currencies disappointed again last year .
  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was one of the key drivers of EM currencies’ weakness last year . Rising commodity prices fueled inflation in the wake of the invasion fueled inflation  across EM, pushing real interest rates into negative territory . In Asia, China's ‘zero-COVID’ policy, multiple lockdowns, and the renminbi’�s 15% peak-to-trough decline led the rest of that bloc . Latin American currencies of Mexico and Brazil ended the year with positive real rates that boosted the credibility of their central banks .
  The Chinese renminbi does not cleanly match either of these criteria . The end of “zero-COVID” will put pressure on China’s current account as its service deficit widens .
  Positive real rates in Mexico and Brazil offer investors attractive incremental yield . Investors will want volatility to subside before overweighting EM currencies . Most bond investors will be glad to turn the page  on 2022 .
  The Bloomberg Global Aggregate Bond Index fell 16%, three times larger than the previous worst reading since the benchmark’s inception in 1990 . All fixed income categories suffered losses last year . Fortunately for bondholders, an encore is unlikely for several reasons .
  We expect lower 10-year yields across most advanced and emerging economies this year . Of course, our constructive view on bonds does not imply the absence of risks . Private markets will need to absorb a record $3 trillion in estimated net bond supply this year (see Exhibit 149)
  Expected Net Supply to the Private  sector across G3 Economies will need to absorb record net issuance . Central banks reduce their balance sheets, private markets will absorb record Net Issues . $2.0 trillion (G3 economies) is $3.1 trillion, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research estimates .
  We think the balance of risks supports positive total returns for intermediate fixed income in our base case . Cash offers attractive returns but unexpected rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in response to a growth shock could erode its yield . High-quality fixed income is the only asset that has hedged against deflationary shocks .
  Investors were left with a historic 16% loss after its yield registered the  largest increase in a calendar year on record . The prospects for 10-year Treasuries are uablybrighter now, with the midpoint of our year-end yield target range implying positive -single-digit returns in 2023 .
  History suggests 10-year yields could peak before or around the second quarter of this year as the Federal Reserve concludes its hiking cycle . The 3.4% midpoint of our forecast implies a more gradual decline in yields than is suggested by history .
  The bond market will have to absorb around $2 trillion of Treasury supply this year—up from  $1.6 trillion in 2022 . US funding needs remain elevated at a time when Federal Reserve is winding down its balance sheet . 2023 Projected Returns: 2023 US Treasury and Municipal Bond Projections .
  In nearly every hiking cycle over the  last 40 years, the 10-year Treasury yield reached its high before or around the time when policy rates peaked . Treasuries are the only asset class that has hedged against deflationary shocks in the past .
  The 12% loss in TIPS last year underperformed similar-duration nominal bonds despite sharpest inflation since the 1980s . We think the outlook for TIPS is brighter in 2023, with 10-year inflation rates already near the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target .
  Bloomberg Municipal Bond Index fell 8.5%, its worst decline since 1982 . Municipal high yield bonds also lost 13.1% for the year . Distribution of risks for intermediate Treasuries has become attractive .
  Inflation expectations fell sharply from their highs and remain well anchored . Inflation swaps track CPI inflation, which has historically run above PCE inflation . The largest exodus from the asset  class since 1984 was also a material headwind .
  Last year’s poor performance stands in contrast to municipal fundamentals, which remain healthy . General fund revenue for states grew 14.5% year-over-year to $1.17 trillion in fiscal 2022, following 16.6% increase in fiscal 2021 .
  US State Governments' Rainy Day Fund balances among state governments stood at  all-time highs in Q3 last year . Credit agency upgrades outpaced downgrades by 4.2 times for tax-backed issuers and 2.7 times for revenue-backed firms .
  Rates, rather than credit spreads, were the key drivers of credit index returns during 2022 . Rainy day funds are budget stabilization funds that may be used to supplement general izations spending during an economic downturn or other events triggering a shortfall .
  Last year saw the worst outflows on record since 1984, with $327 billion of upgrades but just $34 billion of downgrades . While municipal issuer fundamentals are sound, valuations in the sector are less appealing .
  We expect US municipal bonds to generate a low-single-digit gain this year . The number of upgrades outpaced downgrades by a factor  of 2.7–4.2x among municipal bond issuers .
  Incremental yields of municipal bonds have improved since the start of 2022, but remain below long-term averages . US Municipal Bond Upgrades outpaced downgrades by a factor of nearly 10 on par value basis in 2022 .
  US High Yield Municipal Bonds were not immune  to last year’s fixed income weakness . Their relatively long duration (roughly eight years) was particularly costly given sharply higher interest rates last year .
  The incremental yield above that of Treasuries is still below the long-term average . The share of bonds with spreads above 750 bps in the high yield municipal bond universe is low .
  Like broader municipal bonds, the high yield subsector features resilient fundamentals reflected in tighter than normal spreads . Only 1.4% of these bonds trade at distressed spreads, well below the 7.9% average since 2008 .
  The 15.8% decline in investment grade bonds was the worst since 1973 . The 11.2% loss in corporate high yield was its second-worst since 1983 . The bulk of these losses came from sharply higher interest rates rather than credit .
  US High Yield posted its second-worst return on record in 2022 . In turn, high yield bond spreads—which represent investors’ compensation for taking  certainly - are high yield bonds .
  Leveraged loan spreads ended the year close to 2022 highs . The result was that only 3.7% of high yield’s total  11.2% loss was attributable to wider spreads and actual default losses .
  Corporate fundamentals help explain why high yield bond spreads have remained well-behaved . Median leverage among high yield issuers has been lower 11% of the time since 1999 . The earnings of the median issuer are four uablytimes larger than their interest expense, close to the highest coverage ratios on record .
  The share of LBO and M&A-related issuance is below its pre-GFC average . Credit rating agency upgrades of high yield bonds outpaced downgrades by 1.8 times last year . Recovery rates  on defaulted securities were well above average .
  Share of US High Yield New Issuance—Use of Proceeds -- remained low relative to history . Median Leverage and Interest Coverage for US Leveraged Loan Issuers remained healthy during 2022 .
  There is also some credit deterioration already evident in the leveraged loan market . Downgraded  bank loan issuers outnumbered upgraded issuers  by 1.4 times last year . The share of the universe rated BB has fallen below its long-run average . Borrowers have not adequately hedged their interest rate exposure .
  The share of high yield bonds and leveraged loans maturing  in the next two years is low . The shares of distress among both high-yield bonds and  leveraged loans has risen . The share  of distress in the US High Yield Bond and Leveraged Loan Universe has risen.
  The default rate ended last year in the  bottom 15% of its historical distribution, making an increase in 2023 very likely . The risk of refinancing-related defaults is low in the next two years, with less than 10% of the  high yield securities in the high yield market maturing .
  The model implies a 3% par-weighted default rate for high yield bonds this year, roughly in line with their long-term average . The rate is a slightly higher 3.5% for leveraged loans, given the idiosyncratic factors discussed earlier . With default rates normalizing, we expect high yield spreads to widen to around 550 basis points .
  ECB and BOE should extend hiking cycles to a range of 3.25–3.75% and 4.25% . European bonds fell nearly 20%, underperforming US Treasuries in 2022 and Europe faces the same uncomfortable trade-off in 2023 .
  We project default rates to rise during 2023 . Inflation is likely to decrease even more . We are unsure whether inflation expectations will become unanchored .
  The heterogeneous nature of the currency bloc means ECB policy impacts European countries differently . Real rates in Italy stand more than two percentage points above those in Germany despite substantially lower potential growth . Lower economic activity may test central bankers’ resolve and lead to more opaque guidance .
  We expect term premium in the UK gilt market  to remain elevated through 2023, supporting our 3.0–3.5% target range for 10-year gilt yields .
  We think divergences across regions will be critical to the EMLD outlook in 2023 . While monetary policy tightening cycles are close to ending in most EM countries, the dispersion of rates is wide . Brazil and Hungary could end their cycles with policy rates near 14%, compared with near 2% in Korea and Thailand . Interest rate differentials between domestic yields and US yields are much narrower in Asia than in Latin America .
  We think divergences across regions  will be critical to the EMLD outlook in 2023 . While monetary policy tightening cycles are close to ending, the dispersion  of terminal rates is wide .
  EMD’s 18% loss last year represented the worst annual return since its inception in 1993 . The bulk of this loss resulted from the sharp increase in US Treasury yields . EMD spreads have typically widened by 250 basis points during mild recessions and 650 basis  points during deeper global downturns . We forecast positive low-single-digit EMD returns in 2023 .
  EM spreads remain well-behaved and stand near long-run averages . The S&P GSCI returned  23%, topping all other major asset classes for a  prosecutive year . Asia stands out as having a particularly low interest rate  differential .
  Last year’s return for EM external debt was the worst since inception . Investors also faced a wide dispersion among individual commodities and their returns . Industrial metals and precious metals suffered losses last year .
  The energy subindex outperformed with a 39% gain, but the bulk of this came from positive carry . The appreciation in spot energy prices was a much smaller 14% . The tug-of-war between bullish supply-side pressures and bearish demand-side concerns is likely to continue in the year ahead .
  Oil prices last year were driven by geopolitical developments to a degree not seen since the 1970s . As seen in Exhibit 181, 10% of global oil production found itself at risk of disruption virtually overnight in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing Western sanctions . Given already low global oil inventories and thin spare capacity, oil prices spiked higher .
  Russia accounts for a large portion of global oil production . Commodities topped all other major asset classes for a second consecutive year in 2022 .
  Oil prices have receded, but bullish risks that underpinned their initial spike higher  have not disappeared . Investing in commodities involves substantial risk and is not suitable for all investors .
  The full effect of European sanctions on Russia will not be visible in energy markets until the first quarter of this year . Russia has so far been successful at  successfully redirecting crude exports to India and China, but this strategy is starting to show some limits .
  Chinese demand fell by 0.5 million b/d  on average last year, marking the first annual decline since 1990 . OPEC has already ramped its output back to pre-COVID levels and has limited spare capacity . We expect global demand to remain on an ipient trajectory in our base case .
  The November and December oil price slump was rapidly followed by a decline in US drilling and completion activity . OPEC immediately announced a production cut to rescue prices . We expect WTI prices to trade in a $70–100 range by year-end .
  Chinese oil demand has seen a rare and large decline due to COVID . BP recommends overweight overweight to US midstream sector, which benefits from strong cash flows and less exposure to oil price volatility .
  Gold: Not as Advertised as an effective hedge against inflation . Gold's reputation was tarnished in 2022, as gold prices spent most of the year trading in negative territory .
  We do not see a compelling argument for investors to replace their US dollar holdings with gold this year, given our still constructive view on the currency . Positive interest rates create an opportunity cost of holding gold, which generates no cash flow or yield income .
  Positive real rates have historically led to lower-than-average gold returns . Most meaningful rallies have happened when the US dollar  was depreciating .
  The low probability of strong gold returns has not historically justified the risk and volatility of holding the yellow metal . Still, there are a few factors that could buoy gold, not the least of which a US recession might rekindle demand for gold as a safe-haven asset .
  Investor length in gold is still historically elevated, but investor length is well off its peak . US$ Billions are worth $1.2 billion through December 31, 2022 .
